<small><i>2014-02-20 blogging english  When I was a newbie (and a wanna-be) I enjoyed reading "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal", a satiric text that influenced and encouraged me into the path of "C/C++ enlightenment", most even than K&R's book. Since then I thought that being a "Real Programmer" was something close to everything one needs to know to get (hard) things done (quickly). Being a "Quiche Eater" was, in couterpart, comparable to nothing. Real Programmers solve real problems! Quiche Eaters are losers who study the academic concepts of computer science and never do a damn useful and/or working program (maybe you know some guy like this).</small></i>

I've found two great programs to to these things: a API call monitor (update: does not exist anymore) and a COM call monitor (update: either). Besides that, in the first program site - from a enthusiastic of the good for all Win32 Assembly - I've found the source code for one more antidebugging technique, what bring us back to our series of antidebugging techniques.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-08-01 antidebug english projects computer  When a debugger starts a process to be debugged or, the article case, connects to a already created process, the communication between these processes is made through an internal resource inside Windows called LPC (Local Procedure Call). The system creates a "magic" communication port for debugging and the debugging events pass throw it.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-07-30 antidebug english projects computer  In the first article we saw how it's possible to spoof the debugger through exceptions and let the attacker lose some considerable time trying to unbind the program from the fake breakpoints. However, we saw also that this is a difficult solution to keep in the source code, besides its main weakness to be easily bypassed if discovered. Now it's time to put things easier to support and at the same time to guarantee tough times even if the attacker discover what is going on.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-07-28 antidebug english projects computer  A debugger puts breakpoints to stop for a moment the debuggee execution. In order to do this it makes use of a well known instruction: int 3. This instruction throws an exception - the breakpoint exception - that is caught by the operating system and bypassed to the handling code for this exception. For debuggee processes this code is inside the debugger. For free processes this code normally doesn't exist and the application simply crashs.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-05-27 english computer  The biggest advantage running an application as a service, interactive or not, is to allow its start before a logon be performed. An example that happens to me is the need of debugging a [GINA]. In order to do this, I need the Visual Studio remote debugger be started before logon. The easiest and fastest solution is to run Msvcmon, the server part of debugging, as a service.</small></i>

I checked out the Appendix A in the "C ++ - How To Program" (sixth edition) and the book table is equal to the C operators precedence table and it is different from the C++ precedence table presented by you in the article. I went to the internet and found out in two websites the table and both are equal to the book table:</small></i>

Since then I thought that being a "Real Programmer" was something close to everything one needs to know to get (hard) things done (quickly). Being a "Quiche Eater" was, in couterpart, comparable to nothing. Real Programmers solve real problems! Quiche Eaters are losers who study the academic concepts of computer science and never do a damn useful and/or working program (maybe you know some guy like this).</small></i>

<small><i>2008-08-05 computer projects english antidebug blog  The purpose of this protection is to detect if some debugger tries to attach into our running process. The attach to process operation is pretty common in all known debugger, as WinDbg and Visual Studio. Different from the DebugPort protection, this solution avoids the attach action from the debuggee program. In this case the protection can make choices about what to do on the event of attach (terminate the process, send an e-mail, etc).</small></i>

<small><i>2008-08-01 computer projects english antidebug blog  When a debugger starts a process to be debugged or, the article case, connects to a already created process, the communication between these processes is made through an internal resource inside Windows called LPC (Local Procedure Call). The system creates a "magic" communication port for debugging and the debugging events pass throw it.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-07-30 computer projects english antidebug blog  In the first article we saw how it's possible to spoof the debugger through exceptions and let the attacker lose some considerable time trying to unbind the program from the fake breakpoints. However, we saw also that this is a difficult solution to keep in the source code, besides its main weakness to be easily bypassed if discovered. Now it's time to put things easier to support and at the same time to guarantee tough times even if the attacker discover what is going on.</small></i>

<small><i>2008-07-28 computer projects english antidebug blog  A debugger puts breakpoints to stop for a moment the debuggee execution. In order to do this it makes use of a well known instruction: int 3. This instruction throws an exception - the breakpoint exception - that is caught by the operating system and bypassed to the handling code for this exception. For debuggee processes this code is inside the debugger. For free processes this code normally doesn't exist and the application simply crashs.</small></i>

I checked out the Appendix A in the "C ++ - How To Program" (sixth edition) and the book table is equal to the C operators precedence table and it is different from the C++ precedence table presented by you in the article. I went to the internet and found out in two websites the table and both are equal to the book table.</small></i>

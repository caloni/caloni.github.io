<p>&gt; The only way out is in.</p>
<p>&gt; YOU CAN'T BE BORN AGAIN WHEN THERE IS NO YOU</p>
<p>Lendo este livro sobre meditação recomendado no livro Prometheus Rising (ainda preciso escrever sobre esse). Todos os autores se conversam e usam essa editora como linha de frente de publicação de suas ideias. O livro é experimental, para não dizer inacabado, e na mesma vibe dos pensamentos de Robert Anton Wilson e Timothy Leary (entre outros), ele brinca com sua mente.</p>
<p>E como é sobre meditação, brinca com nosso conceito de eu, além de dizer várias vezes que não se pode mudar uma pessoa apenas por ler um livro. É preciso praticar a coisa.</p>
<h2>Dever de casa</h2>
<p>&gt; It would be a damned good idea, right now, to make a list of ten important changes that have occurred in &quot;You&quot; since 1966 (editor: or 20 years ago) and ten changes since 1976 (editor: or 10 years ago).</p>
<p>&gt; Make a list of ten more programs that keep you alive and functioning, over which you have never had any conscious control.</p>
<p>&gt; This theory will help you define your own particular way of coping with life. Make a list of your activities and then analyze each of them in terms of where you stop on the cycle of tension— charge—discharge and relaxation. Look at the way you eat, talk, love, walk, think, feel, and etc.</p>
<p>&gt; Freedom comes from the knowledge of the Orphic Mysteries. Life oscillates between chaos and form. Try on a form, use it —know it—discard it. Then from chaos make a new form. Repeat the Cycles as often as possible and you will feel alive and free.</p>
<p>&gt; (Can you tell when the author is really trying to help? Can you tell when he is just filling up space? Or is he full of shit, just trying to sell books? Why does he use so many styles? Name them.)</p>
<p>&gt; Be conscious at all times of your uniqueness, that your LAB has something to contribute if you do your experiments.</p>
<p>&gt; This exercise can be done at any time (13):</p>
<p>&gt; - Step 1: Find any part of your body where you can sense some tension.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step 2: Identify that tension with an emotive word or phrase.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step 3: Now take that emotion/tension and spread it over your whole body.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step 4: Holding that spread tension (emotion) state, now again scan your body for a new area of tension.</p>
<p>&gt; And now a final exercise, lucky 14. This is an exercise for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>&gt; - Make a list of every trait of yours you can think of.</p>
<p>&gt; - Keep the list handy and keep adding to it over time.</p>
<p>&gt; - Now, with your list, for each of the traits or ways of being, try to do the opposite for a few days.</p>
<p>&gt; - Notice the anxiety (either in planning or in executing). Apply exercise 13 to find out where the pattern came from.</p>
<p>&gt; - Like healthy eating or exercise, exercise 14 is something you should plan for as part of your life from here on.</p>
<h2>Meditação</h2>
<h3>METHOD I</h3>
<p>&gt; - Step I. Sit or lie down. Make Faces ~ Stretch all the muscles in the face. Open your mouth as wide as you can, move the jaw from side to side. At the same time open your eyes as wide as you can. Move your eyes up and down and from side to side. This will begin to destroy tension, thereby destroying uncontrolled and extraneous thoughts generated by this area. Make many different faces. Do this for about 2-3 minutes. (A word of caution: While in the end these exercizes are meant to reduce and eliminate certain thought patterns, some might find an increase of new thoughts from previously &quot;Hidden&quot; places of the mind. If this is the case don't be concerned, since this will be a fine way to perform &quot;mental house cleaning.&quot;)</p>
<p>&gt; - Step II. Hum and Chatter — Hum from the depths of your voice box. Use OM or just MMMM. Do this for 1-2 minutes. Now using your tongue, chatter — DA DA — BA BA BA. Stick out your jaw as far as you can and continue humming and chattering. Do this for 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step III. Shoulders to Ears — Pull your shoulders up as if you were trying to reach your ears. When they start feeling tired, drop them as low as you can. Repeat this 3 times in 2-3 minute intervals.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step IV. Nose Breathing — With your mouth closed take in a deep breath inflating your chest and pulling your stomach up. Be sure to pull the belly in. Hold for a 7 count and then just let the chest fall and the belly relax. Repeat this 10-20 times. Be sure to allow an additional 7 count to elapse before your next inhalation.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step V. Turn Head — Now bring your attention to your head and turn it from side to side as far as you can. Repeat for 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step VI. Leg Stretch — Lying down on your back, hold your legs about 4 inches off the ground and stretch outward. Hold this as long as you can then let them drop. Repeat this 2-3 times.</p>
<p>&gt; - Step VII. Quick Breath — With your mouth slightly open breathe rapidly, sighing as you exhale. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Now lie down and sense and feel your body, for about 10 minutes. Note every sensation you feel. Now assume a meditative position of your choice making sure that:</p>
<p>&gt; - (1) Your eye lids are not tightly closed, but simply relaxed.</p>
<p>&gt; - (2) That your jaw is relaxed and not tense. Make sure of this by trying to stick out your tongue; if you have to lower your jaw, it was too tightly held. Check your forehead making sure it is not wrinkled. Once you are relaxed, either concentrate on your mantra or point of focus. For those students who do not have a mantra or point, we suggest Dr. Regardie's Mantram tape or simply OOOOO-OOOMMMMMMM. For students who wish or require specific images or points of focus, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>&gt; - (3) Finally make sure your throat is not blocked by holding your head in the wrong position. Make sure it is straight. In order to reduce thoughts, keep the eyes relaxed and still, with your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Do not move the larynx and again be sure that your jaw is relaxed. Meditate before eating, or wait for 2-3 hours after eating a heavy meal. It is also best if the bladder and bowels have been emptied before you start your work.</p>
<h3>METHOD II</h3>
<p>&gt; You should have practiced the first stage until you became aware of your deeper tensions. Before starting the second stage be sure your bladder, bowels, and stomach are empty. LIE DOWN ON YOUR BACK Take 10-15 deep breaths starting deep in your guts and work it upward. Try to become aware of all the muscles you use in breathing. When this has been done slowly get up. Stand straight up and count to three. When you reach three let the top part of your body collapse downward at your waist. Do not fall, just let it collapse, do not force it, let gravity pull it down. Repeat this 10-20 times. When you are finished take a few deep breaths and feel the effect this experiment had on you. See if you can sense your pelvic region. Now repeat the same experiment this time exhaling rapidly as you fall and breathing in slowly as you rise. Repeat this 10-20 times and then become aware of the sensations in your body. LIE DOWN ON YOUR BACK Inhale as you do this slowly bring your legs with the knees flexed up to your chest, as you exhale kick your legs out as far and fast as you can. You might want to do this in bed or place some pillows under where your legs will fall. Repeat this until you start feeling tired, then allow your breathing to return to normal. When this happens start again but this time try to hold your legs extended for a second or two before you let them fall. Continue this for a minute or two and then relax again. 79 80 Undoing Yourself Now inhale—on the exhale scream — scream — scream, or if you are a male - yell -yell - yell. Repeat this at least five times. (In order to prevent your friends and neigh- bors from thinking you're nuts and phoning the police I suggest you yell or scream (depending on your sex, of course) into a pillow. Now lie down on your back and sense and feel the energy moving around and through- out your body. Do this for about 5 minutes, and feel the life force move. When you are finished begin your mantram, or if you wish you may use the one recorded by Israel Regardie. If it is used following these experiments it will blow your mind. If you prefer to use your own, record it continually on a tape for at least 20 minutes and then play it back to yourself while you're meditating — Method II is not meant to take the place of Method I, it is just an extension of the experiment. If you are inclined, make a note book or diary of your experiences. There are no-short cuts, so proceed seriously — you can laugh at yourself later — that is unless your laughter begins on its own. When you have completed this experiment try to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes alone. Don't eat or drink, just sense and feel.</p>
<h3>METHOD III</h3>
<p>&gt; Again Method III is not meant to take the place of Method I or II, but is a further extension of the technique. This will take a little more time and you shouldn't try this until you have mastered and documented the effects of the other two methods. STAND UP Bend your knees slightly, not too much and let the top part of your body flop forward. Do not force it — just let it drop. While you're in this position, use a five count breath. Five in, hold five, five out, hold five. Repeat this three times and slowly straighten yourself out. Repeat this sequence 08 times or more. When you're done, stand erect for a few moments with your eyes tightly shut. Become aware of any tension in your face, neck or shoulders. Mobilize these tensions by opening your mouth as wide as you can and distorting your face. Now close your mouth and continue on with these distortions. When you've done this for at least 5 minutes, bend your head back on your shoulders as far as you can, and start turning it from side to side. Some people might get nauseous at this point, so be prepared. If by some chance you desire to vomit go right ahead, since the gag reflex is marvelous for reducing deep body tension. GETTING OUT OF YOUR HEAD Sit down again and think about something which you are worried about. Get up again and pace around the room repeating the phrase, &quot;Wh — ats go — ing to hap — pen to me,&quot; or some equivalent phrase 107 108 Undoing Yourself which expresses worry. Try not to numb yourself while you are doing this. If you feel silly that's fine, because your worry — ing is silly anyway. Now after five minutes sit down in your chair and think of something joyful. When you have it in mind get up and pace around the room repeating the phrase, &quot;I love it,&quot; or some equivalent phrase expressing happiness or joy. When your five minutes are up, imitate laughter as well as you can, then tears, alternating these emotions for at least five minutes. When you are done lie down. Clasp your hands over your chest, pull your knees up and roll yourself up as tight as you can in a ball, tensing every muscle. Hold this position for at least three minutes. Feel your restrictions, now expand, let go of your restriction, let go of everything. As you start to expand let out a shout such as AH! Become aware of your freedom. Repeat this a few times. MEDITATE Choose your mantram, or point of focus, and begin your meditation. SUGGESTIONS There are many ways to use these and the more advanced techniques. Do not become rigid in your experiments — yet remain diligent in your efforts. Some people do better by alternating levels, i.e. use Method I on Monday, II on Wednesday, and III on Saturday, then switch Methods and Days the following week. Others stay with one Method for one month and then switch to others. Be open with your experiments but always remain dedicated to the work. During these periods of experimentation, call yourself by different names, this will help separate the machine you from the emerging Self — the true Scientist of the LAB. If you have any difficulties or questions or wish to find out more information, please feel free to drop me a short note.</p>
<h3>GRAVEYARD</h3>
<p>&gt; Perform your energized meditation exercises. Get into your favorite meditative posture and begin to concentrate on your heart Chakra or on Ajna. Watch all the images pass through your mind. When you have achieved true tranquillity, now imagine that you are in a graveyard. Pick up a shovel and dig up a coffin. Open it up and observe yourself inside. See the worms eating your flesh, watch as your flesh falls off. Create images of all the mistakes and errors you made in you life time. Berate yourself over and over again. Do all of this without losing your tranquillity or your concentration. After you have succeeded at this task repeat the first steps. Once you are completely tranquil begin to create images of your enemies humiliating and degrading you. Imagine them torturing you. Image every hideous thing possible. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated. The next task is to image yourself doing awful things to others. For some this is more difficult than the first two meditations. Next image yourself having the greatest pleasures and joys this world can offer you. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated. Finally image yourself explaining all of this to someone you don't know. Try to convince them of the sanity of this operation.</p>
<h3>OBSERVATION</h3>
<p>&gt; Look out the window and ask yourself as your eyes rest on each object, what is the truth about this tree, lawn, people walking on the street, or whatever your glance rests on? Mentally strip the objects to the facts that you perceive. Even your perception of what you believe to be facts concerning it or them is likely to be distorted -nevertheless your efforts to confine your conclusions to the apparent facts concerning it will help you to increase your awareness of how distorted are all our perceptions concerning everything in our lives. We rarely view anything without our fleshy robot machine being right in the middle. Almost all of our conclusions are based on &quot;trained&quot; input — which categorically means dogma.</p>
<p>&gt; The main reason you shouldn't be afraid of this attack on your precious little ego is that the ego is infinitely resourceful and finds ways to sneak back into its habitual mechanical trance no matter how many times you think you have Awakened once and for all.</p>
<p>&gt; We are the products of mechanical genetic programs, mechanical imprints and mechanical conditioning, just like the other animals.</p>
<p>&gt; There seem to be genuine biological reasons why we need to spend about one third of our lives asleep and a large part of the other two-thirds half-entranced by mechanical conditioned processes. The purpose of all schools of liberation is to wake up fully often enough to have some perspective outside the sleeping and conditioned ego states.</p>
<p>&gt; From the point of view of current science, c. 1980-87, there appear to be two things wrong with this Aristotelian mind-set. In the first place, scientific models are not expressed in this metaphor of identity (A is a B) but in the functional language of relationships (When A moves an increment of x in any dimension, B will move an increment of y in some other dimension.) The latter type of functional statement allows for scientific predictions, which can be partially verified or totally refuted by experience and experiment; the former, Aristotelian type of is-ness statement leads only to verbal argument.</p>
<p>&gt; The second objection to Aristotelian A is a B statements is that they appear totally contradicted by neurology and experiments with instruments. Neurologically, we never know what A &quot;is,&quot; but what it appears to our senses and brain.</p>
<p>&gt; The skin is the psycho-physical barrier between our personal and public selves. The skin, if you would, is the sensate membrane of how we know who, what and where we are, and what we are doing.</p>
<p>&gt; The body, the skin, represents both our individuality which we cherish, and at the same time our vulnerability which we abhor.</p>
<p>&gt; Thus public exposure regardless of form is always a threat, be it spatial or psychological. In other words, we are always scared of each other.</p>
<p>&gt; As long as our biology demands our survival, our primary mode of operation is fear. However, we are deliberately made unaware of this, or told that our anxieties are abnormal. In fact our anxieties are the most normal things about us and are the fuel and engine from which society and culture are built.</p>
<p>&gt; WHAT we do is determined, HOW we do it is relative.</p>
<p>&gt; Gurdjieff, one of the most powerful &quot;real&quot; teachers of &quot;real&quot; self-change, said LIFE IS REAL ONLY THEN, WHEN &quot;1 AM.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; Our sleeping Brain is capable of anything and everything we wish. The solution to man's &quot;problems&quot; lies in first getting &quot;himself out of his own way, and then re-programming his brain according to his &quot;true will&quot;. Man's freedom is not in his conditioned ego-personality or his castrated visions of gods and demons but in his desire and ability to change himself.</p>
<p>&gt; To achieve Enlightenment (The Real Knowledge That You Are A Robot And Have Been Programmed, And That You Can Re-Program Your Brain According To Your True Will.) you must first put yourself aside.</p>
<p>&gt; The body must be free from the Robotic Mind and allowed to express itself freed from all snares. And finally the Mind must become a SLAVE of the True Will.</p>
<p>&gt; As you become more astute in achieving deep relaxation, you will realize that you can have complete control of your life through the ability to reprogram your mind. However, to accomplish this you must first learn to reduce all un—necessary tension and stress.</p>
<p>&gt; The technical aspects of this idea are overwhelming. While meditation reduces tension, tension also reduces the result of meditation. For this reason concentration on a mantra can never be achieved to complete satisfaction. This is one of the major problems to which Energized Meditation addresses itself.</p>
<p>&gt; We will find out that Undoing Yourself is another phrase for &quot;God Is Dead,&quot; the final obituary of stupidity, the end of the single brain—the single self—the freedom from restrictions, the new Nirvana(s). Undoing Yourself is the Religions of Sisters/ Brothers.</p>
<p>&gt; I use the term 'geography' (lines dividing time and space on a piece of paper) to refer to culture and psychology. Psychoculture is the result of genes interacting with geography.</p>
<p>&gt; In a primitive sense, culture and psychology are territory.</p>
<p>&gt; All wars are wars between slaves. Each competing hoard of geoslaves believes that its form of slavery is better. A country by any other name is a choice between serfdoms. Each bible is simply a slave's survival manual—a HOW TO book!</p>
<p>&gt; One purpose of chaos, paradox, nonsense, and absurdity is to set itself against the linear world. These are not meant to take the place of linear knowledge or functions, but to act as a point of focus calling our attention and awareness to the something(s) which the linear model has missed, thus breathing new life into the predictable.</p>
<p>&gt; In other words there is a sense of independence that we can create from our tacit assumptions which have created a false isomorphism between the inside and outside. I use a method called flip/flop which entails moving from emotion to thought to action and back again in an almost random fashion.</p>
<p>&gt; To Believe that the origin of the Plant is the Flower is to believe that the rational mind is the origin of life</p>
<p>&gt; At first our entire survival depends on the unknown, the ground of life. It is completely magickal.</p>
<p>&gt; The inheritors of the future are not those who are impulsive nor those who have identified the rational process as their God. I am equally frightened of both groups.</p>
<p>&gt; Do not identify the flower of mankind with its roots, nor cut off the flower denying its root. Both games are deadly.</p>
<p>&gt; TO PERFORM MAGICK MEANS TO GATHER GREAT AMOUNTS OF PSYCHO-EMOTIVE- BIO-CHEMICAL ENERGY TO A POINT AND DIRECT IT AT WILL</p>
<p>&gt; Ritual is the tying together of things, emotions, events and environments through the process of spontaneous imagination with the WILL TO MANIFEST.</p>
<p>&gt; TRUE RITUAL Is LIVING at its highest Intensity To LIVE at the highest means to LIVE in the Power of moments.</p>
<p>&gt; The frustration of Desire at its most primal level stimulates the development of the faculties of persistence and reason. At this level we are touching upon the ideas of a future. It is the planning aspect, the deliberate activity of a sequence of acts leading to goals and ideals. It is the Mother of formal philosophy and science.</p>
<p>&gt; In spite of the disappointment of those who wish to CURE LIFE, CHAOTIC DESIRE will LIVE on to generate new and different life FORMS.</p>
<p>&gt; In the end, this civilization will be destroyed not because of the Magickal process, (Original Sin, Primary Process, Disobedience) but because of civilization's attempts to Destroy — MAGICK. This is the inherent inter-play of the Goddess, Create/Destroy.</p>
<p>&gt; REMEMBER, ALL TRUE SPIRITUAL CHANGE, BY ITS VERY NATURE, HAS UNPREDICTABLE QUALITIES.</p>
<p>&gt; I have heard every explanation devised to deal with the void, but I find the one which works best is an hour or so of forced depression. This makes the rest of the day free for other things.</p>
<p>&gt; If they understand, you can rest assured that they are not normal and are worthy of your friendship and consideration. If they think you are mad, invoke the notion of tradition. Argue that the Tantrics and Buddhists used graveyards for meditations and that many of the early Christians tortured themselves to purify themselves.</p>
<p>&gt; If everything in the Universe could be known or controlled man would no longer exist as we know him. Thus, to know the nature of a man we simply must ask how he defines both the Numinous and himself and how he lives in relationship to these definitions. Thus, the God(s) of every culture—like the God(s) of every man—is a sign of its strength or weakness.</p>
<p>&gt; When you have completed your ratings write a short paragraph describing the relationship between man and his God(s). Finally, and most importantly, create your own God (vision of the Numinous) and rate Him or Her. Also rate how this God &quot;sees&quot; you. This method will provide you with a map of how a culture or a man perceives himself in relation to the Numinous. It will also allow you to make predictions about how a man or a culture will change over time.</p>
<p>&gt; This Law—Stay simple, Stay lean—is the basic law of science and &quot;should&quot; be the basic law of life. Stay simple, Stay lean has nothing whatsoever to do with dogmatism. It means—don't complicate something until facts force you to do so. Facts in this case includes your own needs.</p>
<p>&gt; The words you think with affect the world you live in. As we realize that we are our own greatest &quot;works&quot; of art as well as the co-artists of the world in which we reside, and exercise our talents, we give ourselves residence in the world of magic, happily juggling our self concepts along with our realities. So the preliminary task for any brain change artist is to get rid of his or her armour /shell/linguistic filter and get acquainted with the life underneath. William Blake knew what he was talking about when he wrote, &quot;I must create my own system, or be enslaved by another's.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; The goddess Eris (or Discordia) is the midwife of Chaos, the bringer of creative destruction. For those aspiring to the magickal life, she will be a most helpful handmaiden, a necessary preliminary, an archetype whose invokation is necessary if a New Order be wrought.</p>
<p>&gt; Real-life experiments conducted by Dr. Lilly suggested that it was possible to &quot;visit&quot; our selves in various states of evolution, but of course physical transformation did not occur. It was the mind which took a ride on a genetic elevator of sorts, allowing re-cognition and realization of the primeval consciousness and/or cosmic consciousness. The point is that we can access the Self beneath the programming and choose to change our minds/ realities, become the meta-programmers of our brains rather than the puppets of the culture we were bread in by applying the magickal formula: Will + Imagination + Altered States.</p>
<p>&gt; Brain-change technicians are meta-programmers who dance through dozens of virtual realities. We re-program ourselves, clothing ourselves with new belief systems or realities as creatively and as often AS WE WILL. (As I see it, the more often we change, the faster we evolve.)</p>
<p>&gt; There are thousands of ways to invoke Eris. You might devote yourself to meditation on the TOWER card, or better yet, draw or paint your own. It helps to get out of your head where all your programs, as well as the potential re-actions to your current programs and future programs exist. Forget the mind; get into your body. Prior to practicing brain-change rituals, prepare yourself and your space by breaking apart &quot;normal&quot; reality. Perform a frenzied Erisian dance, whirling like a crazy dervish until you don't know which way is which, stand on your head for an hour, indulge in extended sexual practice or tantra (prolonged sexual activity is perhaps the simplest and most pleasurable way to alter consciousness), or have sex with an unusual person under unusual circumstances. Throw yourself into an extreme emotional state (terror, devotion, or anger), drum until you become the beat, give your ear to dissonant music, or stare at a cubist painting until you understand it. Hold your breath or try Kriya Yoga techniques. Laugh for the sake of laughter and nothing else (listen to the song &quot;I Love to Laugh&quot; on the Mary Poppins soundtrack for a couple of hours). Talk gibberish or practice Socratic dialectic with yourself. Invoking Eris in your daily life will take some of the tedium out of mundane tasks and greatly speed up your passage into a magickal multiple FUN reality. A good way to start is to break habits and replace them with new ones, then break the new habits and replace them, and so on. Or, walk in a different way, talk to strangers, act &quot;out of character&quot; (tell your friends you're performing an experiment), wear clothing which is not your style, explore new routes to work, eat exotic foods, eat on the floor, eat without utensils, write with the hand you don't write with, try to believe in ideas you abhor (except during elections), make love to someone who is not your &quot;type&quot;. Really. Sex with &quot;unattractive&quot; partners is said to have been a favored method of self-concept disintegration for at least one notorious brain-change expert. When pleasure is combined with repulsion, two contrary values are married, your judgment is dissolved, and you are lifted beyond duality into oneness. As you give your former &quot;static&quot; reality various Erisian jolts, continuously question your beliefs about the world, your ideas of yourself, your goals and desires. Be brutally &quot;honest&quot; and beg your friends to do the same. Find out where you are and why; you can search your &quot;soul&quot; more effectively than any therapist. What is important is that you recognize the foundations, scaffolds, and walls of your &quot;normal&quot; reality; and demolish them and build anew. To maintain residence in magickal reality keep turning the channel again and again and again. If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards! Evolve! As we become expert brain-change technicians and enter the realm of magick, synchronicities become common occurrences and wishes come true so frequently that one refrains from wishing carelessly. Things just fall into place. We no longer have to put aside time specifically for such practices; instead, we live magickally. Eris provides the necessary dis-orientation and dis-illusionment, both in our rituals and our everyday lives, so we may cast off the shells which separate our essential spark, in all its marvelous and ancient luminosity, from that of everything else in the universe. And so we realize that &quot;All the World's a Stage&quot; and &quot;Every Man and Woman is a Star,&quot; thus becoming the directors, producers, and actors of our lives.</p>
<p>&gt; The problem of opposites lies in the inadequate information gained from the Tree of Knowledge. (See the story of the man in the room above.) When man learned about good and evil he did not learn how empty words are like a container that can be filled with various liquids.</p>
<p>&gt; The Opposites have served as a primitive model of classifying, ordering and &quot;understanding&quot; the universe. The problem lies in the fact that Opposites do not exist apart from the mind (or, each other). Anything &quot;understood&quot; by Opposites can equally and probably better be understood in terms of scales such as, so much of X or Y. The process of thinking in Opposites create an illusion of Opposition, a world of Conflict, which in fact may not exist independent of our beliefs.</p>
<p>&gt; For the man in the street, the philosophies of opposites, particularly Good and Evil, have served as a torture chamber, a crucifix made from metaphor. Thrust into a world which views him as the property of Gods and States and overwhelmed by an un-repayable debt, the metaphysics of slavery and the facts of pain, pleasure and death; bolstered by science, whose theories have become the whores of the state, man is now informed that he is ill. The proof of this is his refusal to submit completely.</p>
<p>&gt; Could we say then, that his evil was simply losing, or was it the &quot;more important&quot; fact that he employed violence? If so, what of the American Indian and other races and cultures destroyed by the Christian notion of a pure white race. And what of the Blacks in America? No, most humans would argue that Hitler's evil was something more. What was it? It may have been because it happened in our own time, it was blatant, he lost the war, he crossed his genetic borders, or attacked the &quot;chosen people&quot; or ??</p>
<p>&gt; As Nietzsche has shown, evil is an intention serving a purpose. It allows one group to justify its will to power over another, just as it has been used to intimidate most men.</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;The wife has no rights over her own body, the husband has them.&quot; —I Corinthians, 7:4</p>
<p>&gt; If we accept the Model of the Cyber-Shaman (that man OWNS HIRSELF), 95 percent of the so-called problems—which we read about in newspapers, hear about on the radio, watch on television and discuss with friend—DO NOT EXIST. Thus, all proposed SOLUTIONS for these PSEUDO-PROBLEMS are MEANINGLESS. The concept of OWNERSHIP starts in the cradle and does not end, even in the grave. Thus, our solution is not eradication of OWNERSHIP but rather REPOSSESSING the SELF</p>
<p>&gt; You have noted, of course, that 911—the date when the World Trade Center was destroyed—is the same as the emergency phone number in the U.S.</p>
<p>&gt; You can't return to something that never was. This simple but horrid fact puts an end to all experts who are calculating formulas to create a perfect world.. .instead of sleeping.</p>
<p>&gt; If I were a Freudian therapist, I would say he has painted a powerful picture of the damage done to all of us by our own self-punitive superego. The superego is that part of ourselves which demands that we live by rules, not by choice. It is the part of ourselves that loads us down with guilt, with shame, with the rigidity of personality and body which prevents us from living in the moment with joy. Dr. Hyatt has painted the picture of that inner cop and provided exercises you can use by yourself to liberate some of the rigidity of the body. My task is to add some exercises you can use to liberate the rigidity in your personality.</p>
<p>&gt; But undoing yourself means to have the courage to do that which gives you pleasure and not do those things which are only duty or habit.</p>
<p>&gt; When you can do it at will with no self-recrimination and no guilt, then you can see if, in fact, you are not rather enjoying it.</p>
<p>&gt; When doing any of these exercises (and in doing them with any particular thing or way), there are two good indicators that you are on the right path. One indicator is guilt, shame, or disapproval. The other is anxiety.</p>
<p>&gt; As you work through these exercises and the energized meditation that Dr. Hyatt has provided, you are changing your superego and thus your feelings. As a matter of fact, one of the hallmarks of the person acting at a higher level of psychological development4 is that his thinking or evaluation of a situation and his emotions (body state) come to be in greater harmony. That is actually a measure you can use to watch your progression through energized meditation to what Scientologists call &quot;clear.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; But aren't you still angry? Aren't you boiling inside even if you don't show it? In a way, yes; but the anger is converted into a physical symptom like heartburn, or ulcers, or a headache.</p>
<p>&gt; As you develop, you will find less and less conflict between your thinking and your emotions. The current situation is only the stimulus to the recall of past emotion. Almost always, on this second emotion, you will spontaneously recover a memory of when these two emotions occurred together. There is no reason to stop at two areas of tension. If two does not get you to a memory, try for a third pass (identify, grow, scan, identify). The more you do this, the better at it you will get and the more you will be able to unscrew the inscrutable.</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;...integrity is honesty turned inward: the refusal to lie to yourself about yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; DON'T DECIDE AHEAD OF TIME THAT IT IS IMPORTANT OR UNIMPORTANT. DON'T DECIDE AHEAD OF TIME THAT WHAT THAT PERSON SAID ABOUT YOU IS NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>&gt; Together, the oral teachings and the individual personal effort produce an effect that would eventually bring about a change or transformation in the spiritual nature of the student. This change, in turn, would allow the student to successfully work in the practical laboratory phase of alchemy. &quot;Know thyself!&quot; were among his special watchwords that he tried to instill in all of us.</p>

<p>Voltei a folhear em uma madrugada esse livrinho. Não lembro se acabei o capítulo anterior de Números, mas, honestamente, não estou interessado em descobrir. O texto é maçante, repetitivo e quase que inútil para aprendermos qualquer coisa sobre esses judeus exceto que eles são muito numerosos, burros e precisam do uso da força e da lei para sair do deserto e conseguir terras.</p>
<p>Neste novo capítulo segue-se um flashback de Moisés se lamentando que o deus não vai deixar ele entrar na terra prometida. Ele recapitula tudo que passou com seu povo. Ainda não terminei.</p>
<p>&gt; Normalmente, são necessários apenas onze dias para viajar do monte Sinai até Cades-Barneia pelo caminho do monte Seir.</p>
<p>&gt; Então o rei Seom declarou guerra contra nós e mobilizou todas as suas tropas em Jaza. Mas o SENHOR, nosso Deus, o entregou a nós, e matamos a ele, seus filhos e todo o seu povo. Conquistamos todas as suas cidades e as destruímos completamente. Matamos homens, mulheres e crianças. Não poupamos ninguém.</p>
<p>&gt; Exterminamos todo o povo das cidades que conquistamos, tanto homens como mulheres e crianças. Ficamos, porém, com todos os animais e levamos os despojos das cidades.</p>
<p>(Curioso como se gabam dessas atrocidades. Mais de uma vez.)</p>
<p>&gt; Obedeçam-lhes por completo, e assim demonstrarão sabedoria e inteligência às nações vizinhas. Quando elas ouvirem estes decretos, exclamarão: ‘Como é sábio e prudente o povo dessa grande nação!’.</p>
<p>&gt; O SENHOR os dispersará entre as nações, onde apenas alguns de vocês sobreviverão.</p>
<p>&gt; Quando o SENHOR, seu Deus, entregá-las em suas mãos e vocês as conquistarem, destruam-nas completamente. Não façam tratados nem tenham pena delas. Não se unam a elas por meio de casamentos. Não deem suas filhas em casamento aos filhos delas, nem tomem as filhas delas como esposas para seus filhos, pois farão seus filhos se afastarem de mim para adorar outros deuses.</p>
<p>&gt; O SENHOR, seu Deus, expulsará essas nações de diante de vocês, pouco a pouco.</p>
<p>&gt; Ele as lançará em total confusão, até que sejam destruídas. Entregará os reis dessas nações em suas mãos, e vocês apagarão o nome deles da face da terra. Ninguém poderá lhes resistir, e vocês destruirão a todos.</p>
<p>&gt; Reconheça, portanto, que o SENHOR, seu Deus, não lhe dá essa boa terra como propriedade porque você é justo, pois não é. Na verdade, você é um povo teimoso.”</p>

<p>&gt; &quot;Os filósofos gostam de acreditar que estão erigindo sistemas imparciais e rigorosos para explicar a ação humana e o universo, quando, na realidade, as filosofias são expressões de inclinações e perspectivas pessoais.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; William James (Pragmatismo)</p>
<p>Livro bacana e simplista sobre alguns tópicos explorados por alguns filósofos. Não é rigososo, mas é muito gostoso de ler pelo leigo, pois possui uma cadência mais voltada para apenas explicar as conclusões sem exigir a argumentação. É o oposto de [Just the Arguments], que mantém o rigor bem em alta (e faz queimar alguns neurônios).</p>
<p>&gt; Bertrand Russell registrou quase a mesma ideia em sua obra de caráter muito pessoal A conquista da felicidade. Ele escreveu que o esforço, ainda mais que o sucesso, é um ingrediente essencial da felicidade; uma pessoa que é capaz de satisfazer todos os seus caprichos sem esforço considera que a realização dos desejos não contribui para a felicidade. Um foco sobre o eu é uma causa de infelicidade, ao passo que a alegria vem de direcionar nossos interesses para fora, jogando-nos para dentro da vida.</p>
<p>&gt; “As atividades em acordo com a virtude guiam a felicidade”, disse Aristóteles. Portanto, a felicidade não é o prazer, mas um subproduto de uma vida significativa, e a importância tende a vir do empenho e da autodisciplina.</p>
<p>&gt; O orador romano Cícero acreditava que cada indivíduo é uma centelha ou uma lasca de Deus, e, assim, tratar outro ser humano mal é como agir contra nós mesmos.</p>
<p>&gt; Platão acreditava que fazer a coisa certa é a própria recompensa, uma vez que harmoniza as três partes da alma (razão, espírito e desejo).</p>
<p>&gt; Alguns séculos antes, na China, Confúcio disse praticamente a mesma coisa, observando que, embora nasçamos humanos, nos tornamos uma pessoa por meio do cumprimento de papéis responsáveis na sociedade de uma forma altruísta.</p>
<p>&gt; Em seu livro de referência, Uma teoria da justiça, John Rawls pede que imaginemos que todo mundo em uma sociedade perdeu sua memória sobre seu lugar e seu status e, em seguida, que configuremos uma nova sociedade baseada em conceder a máxima oportunidade para todos florescerem. Considerando que na loteria da vida poderíamos ter nascido tanto pobres quanto reis, não nos esforçaríamos para garantir que todos tivessem ao menos uma oportunidade igual de sucesso?</p>
<p>&gt; Essa perspectiva utilitarista nos leva até Jeremy Bentham, no século XVIII. Bentham passou a vida promovendo seu princípio da “maior felicidade ao maior número de pessoas”.</p>
<p>&gt; Em Quanto custa salvar uma vida?, o filósofo contemporâneo Peter Singer cita Epicuro: “É impossível levar uma vida agradável sem também viver de forma sensata, nobre e justa”. A boa vida não consiste apenas em ter boa saúde, propriedades, carros novos e feriados, mas em pensar e agir sobre o que pode ser feito para tornar o mundo mais justo.</p>
<p>&gt; A filosofia de Rawls está na mesma tradição de Rousseau, que acreditava que uma sociedade livre eleva e enobrece os seus cidadãos, mas também implica responsabilidades e uma disposição de abrir mão de um tanto de liberdade pessoal em prol das necessidades do todo.</p>
<p>&gt; A atemporal argumentação de John Stuart Mill acerca da liberdade individual, Sobre a liberdade, continha seu famoso princípio do “dano” para assegurar liberdade: “O único propósito pelo qual o poder poderá ser legitimamente exercido sobre qualquer membro de uma comunidade civilizada, contra a sua vontade, é para evitar dano a outrem”.</p>
<p>&gt; O problema, como Maquiavel enfatizou com sinceridade brutal em O príncipe, é que o cidadão comum simplesmente não considera o que é preciso para manter um Estado poderoso e pode continuar a viver uma vida moral, enquanto os governantes precisam tomar decisões “sujas”.</p>
<p>&gt; Noam Chomsky, uma perene pedra no sapato da complacência liberal ocidental, tem uma visão similarmente obscura do poder. Ele acredita que a maioria dos Estados contemporâneos é configurada para servir aos interesses do poder, e o verdadeiro inimigo dos que estão no poder é sua população; a maioria das guerras é projetada para tirar a atenção da situação interna.</p>
<p>&gt; Iris Murdoch, que defende em A soberania do bem que, se buscarmos o bem primeiro, tudo o mais que vale a pena virá até nós naturalmente. Ao contrário, se buscarmos apenas a vontade muscular, isso é tudo que teremos no fim das contas.</p>
<p>&gt; Kant também acreditava que, como seres humanos existentes no espaço e no tempo, e com as limitações de nossos sentidos, estamos impedidos de perceber as coisas como elas realmente são (“coisas em si”). Mas há uma verdade metafísica elementar por trás do mundo de percepções, e, por meio da razão, podemos ao menos nos aproximar um pouco dela.</p>
<p>&gt; Para Hegel, a verdadeira história da ciência não é a “descoberta do universo”, mas sim a descoberta de nossa própria mente – da própria consciência. História, ciência e filosofia são simplesmente expressões de como a consciência despertou ao longo do tempo.</p>
<p>&gt; De fato, como o filósofo da ciência Thomas Kuhn mostrou em A estrutura das revoluções científicas, e Michel Foucault também observou, o conhecimento não procede em uma linha pura para cima, com um edifício de descobertas sobre o outro; em vez disso, cada era tem uma lente através da qual se vê o mundo, e algo é percebido como real apenas se a lente permite que seja visto assim.</p>
<p>&gt; Em Investigações filosóficas, Wittgenstein admitiu que tinha se equivocado na visão expressa anteriormente em seu Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus de que a linguagem é um meio de descrever o mundo. As palavras não apenas nomeiam as coisas; muitas vezes elas transmitem um significado elaborado, e muitos significados diferentes a partir da mesma palavra. A linguagem não é uma lógica formal que marca os limites de nosso mundo, mas um jogo social em que a ordem do jogo é livre e evolui.</p>
<p>&gt; Hoje, uma pessoa não é um projeto na sua individualidade, buscando o que é “verdadeiro”, e sim se assemelha mais a uma máquina que consome e reproduz ideias e imagens.</p>
<p>&gt; Arendt recorda a ênfase de Jesus de Nazaré na ação, especialmente no ato de perdoar, como ponto importante da história, pois essa descoberta concedeu a nós, e não apenas a Deus, o poder de anular ações passadas.</p>
<p>&gt; Arendt escreve: Somente por meio dessa constante libertação mútua daquilo que fazem, os homens poderão continuar sendo agentes livres, somente pela constante disposição de mudar a mente e recomeçar é que poderão receber em confiança um poder tão grande para começar algo novo.</p>
<p>&gt; A distinção entre homem e animal permeia a própria espécie humana: apenas os melhores (aristoi), que constantemente provam ser os melhores e que “preferem a fama imortal às coisas mortais”, são realmente humanos; os outros, contentes com quaisquer prazeres que a natureza lhes traz, vivem e morrem como animais.</p>
<p>&gt; A “causa final” de Aristóteles diz que tudo na natureza é construído com um fim ou objetivo em mente: uma árvore ou uma pessoa é programada para florescer de uma determinada maneira e usa as condições disponíveis para fazê-lo.</p>
<p>&gt; Uma vida de mero prazer, uma vez que nos priva de atividade racional e funcional ao longo de uma existência em busca de um objetivo, não vai nos tornar felizes.</p>
<p>&gt; A felicidade genuína surge por meio do trabalho em nós mesmos e em nossos objetivos ao longo do tempo. “Uma andorinha só não faz verão, tampouco um dia”, diz Aristóteles, “nem, da mesma forma, um dia ou um curto espaço de tempo nos torna abençoados e felizes.” Ele descreve o próprio tempo como “um bom parceiro na descoberta”, revelando tanto a nossa natureza como a do mundo.</p>
<p>&gt; Por meio da ação plenamente justificada e construtiva, ajudamos os amigos a alcançar seus objetivos, e, ao fazê-lo, nossas qualidades racionais ou nosso caráter são ampliados. Naturalmente, isso nos faz felizes. O mesmo princípio aplica-se à comunidade ou cidade em que vivemos. Trabalhando para sua melhoria, é natural que fortaleçamos nosso caráter e, portanto, aumentemos nossa felicidade.</p>
<p>&gt; Nós nos tornamos construtores construindo e nos tornamos harpistas tocando harpa. Da mesma forma, então, nos tornamos justos praticando ações justas, moderados praticando ações moderadas, corajosos praticando ações corajosas”. Em outras palavras, nós nos tornamos pessoas bem-sucedidas pelo hábito.</p>
<p>&gt; Uma pessoa bem-sucedida e feliz é aquela que é estável por meio do cultivo da virtude, que torna os caprichos da fortuna irrelevantes. É essa estabilidade, nobreza e magnanimidade que mais admiramos. “As atividades segundo a virtude guiam a felicidade”, diz Aristóteles.</p>
<p>A maior parte da língua diz mais sobre o falante do que sobre a “realidade”.</p>
<p>&gt; O pensamento de Ayer sobre a verificabilidade e as declarações significativas veio de sua crença no “naturalismo” ou na ideia de que a filosofia deveria ser tratada no mesmo nível que a ciência natural, ou seja, colocando todo tipo de afirmação da verdade sob o escrutínio mais minucioso. Embora não tivesse esperança de desmantelar todo o campo da metafísica, conseguiu limitar os filósofos a pronunciamentos que ao menos fizessem sentido.</p>
<p>&gt; A ideia pós-modernista é que os seres humanos são essencialmente construções moldadas pela linguagem, pela socialização e pelas relações de poder, mas Baggini conclui que somos mais do que meras construções: temos unidade e continuidade, mesmo não tendo uma essência fixa ou alma eterna.</p>
<p>&gt; Considerando sua posição relativamente privilegiada – carreira docente, nível universitário, frequência em círculos intelectuais parisienses –, Beauvoir nunca tinha experimentado a sensação de injustiça ou desigualdade. No entanto, começou a perceber que as pessoas a enxergavam como inferior a Sartre apenas porque era do sexo feminino.</p>
<p>&gt; Uma pessoa é um homem, e nenhuma explicação a mais é necessária, enquanto uma mulher deve ser descrita como uma pessoa do sexo feminino. O resultado, comenta Beauvoir, é que a mulher é “a incidental, a inessencial, como o oposto ao essencial. Ele é o sujeito, ele é Absoluto – ela é o Outro”. Ela observa que o termo “Outro” pode ser aplicado a qualquer grupo da sociedade que não é considerado o grupo “principal”.</p>

<p>Comecei a assistir esta série alguns episódios após o começo sem querer por estar no sofá e tive que assistir do começo depois de ver um episódio chamado O Review que é um plano-sequência só que é um primor de técnica narrativa, construção de clima e interação de personagens. Mesmo sem saber muito da história você já sente que virão grandes acontecimentos. E tudo em 20 minutos, os melhores 20 minutos este ano assistindo TV. Esta é uma série fotografada com o esmero sagrado dos que se dedicam ao seu melhor. Seu roteiro arrisca e escolhe uma abordagem sutil em meio a uma tempestade, com diálogos que não expõem, mas complementam.</p>

<p>O roteirista Richard Curtis entrega um material tão humano, sensível e irônico que é como se não estivéssemos em uma comédia romântica. Este é um filme sobre amigos passando momentos juntos. Sobre romances acontecendo. E nada é do outro mundo. Essas pessoas tão reais estão alheias ao filme que elas participam, este conteúdo denso e complexo. Um dos filmes mais humanos possíveis, em que nós quase não acreditamos que há um roteiro por trás. Como Memórias de Ontem, um passeio pelas trivialidades de acontecimentos entre amigos, mas dentro dos enigmáticos rituais pós (ou pré) acasalamentos humanos. Acaba sendo fofinho à sua maneira. Os sorrisos de Hugh Grant e Andie McDonald são o suficiente para estipular o casal ideal que não vive em um mundo idem. Uma edição e direção fluidas faz o tempo passar rápido, mas sem antes repararmos nos detalhes às vezes hilários, como uma senhorinha dormindo no canto da escada enquanto os noivos tiram fotos ou o complexo desprezo dos ricos pelos convidados mais humildes. Ou até mesmo a escalada de um aprendiz de padre que se torna a participação confortante e engraçada de Mr. Bean. Tudo colabora para que este filme ainda seja relevante. Talvez mais ainda.</p>

<p>Essa música tema dos anos 70 e essa produção televisiva de qualidade duvidosa é ótima. Linda não foi a primeira mulher maravilha. A primeira é do ano anterior, quando tentaram vender em um longa a ideia da Wonder Woman como uma James Bond feminina com alguns poderes velados. Não há nem o uniforme dos quadrinhos. Não gostaram. Tentaram de novo com uma versão mais canônica possível. Deu certo. Essa produção vendeu por quatro temporadas. Os vilões são canastrões e datados da segunda guerra. Os efeitos nem se falam. Mas o carisma e a postura da atriz compensam. Boas sacadas de humor, bom uso de feminismo. É interessante comparar com a versão de Gal Gadot. Assista pelo menos um episódio.</p>

<h2>Uma ode apressada ao gosto pessoal</h2>
<p>Gosto não se discute (se lamenta). Neste curtíssimo livro alguns autores publicam cartinhas abertas sobre por que não gostam de filmes que supostamente quase todo mundo adora. A sacada seria boa se houvesse algum raciocínio por trás destas opiniões. Mas não. É o não gosto pelo não gosto. Eles próprios admitem não saber por que não gostam desses filmes. Quando você admite não saber sobre uma coisa e decide escrever sobre isso, você está espalhando ignorância sob a bandeira da diversidade, ou seja, é duplamente ignorante, por não entender o que é diversidade.</p>

<p>Este é um dos melhores musicais que já vi em toda minha vida. Ponto. Ele ainda é bom hoje, em 2024. Ele nos faz entender boa parte do cinema como é feito (uma aula), mas também possui uma história empolgante, dinâmica, auxiliada por um elenco absurdo de bom, cantando, dançando e atuando. Além de ensinar sobre cinema o filme ensina a verdadeira quebra de paradigma (no sentido real do termo, sem exagero) que foi a mudança de cinema mudo para falado. [O Artista] é uma obra que homenageia essa transição. Cantando na Chuva é um filme que vai além: ele não se ancora em melancolia, mas impulsiona nossa visão do futuro brilhante que o cinema terá pela frente. Suas cenas de dança não são apenas absurdamente sincronizadas, mas a câmera conduzida por Gene Kelly e Stanley Donen estabelecem critérios que estão anos-luz à frente de diretores medíocres como Tom Hopper (que fez, ironicamente, um musical de Os Miseráveis que faz parte de uma piada deste filme).</p>

<h1 class="chapter-subtitle"><strong>The Systems Model of Creativity (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)</strong></h1>
<p class="note-title">2024-08-07 <a href="_202408.xhtml#_filmes_que_odeio_mas_todo_mundo_ama">&lt;</a><a href="toc_books.xhtml">books</a><a href="_202408.xhtml#_undoing_yourself_christopher_s_hyatt">&gt;</a></p>

<p>&gt; The resurgence of scientific interest in creativity is in itself an instructive story about how fads in science are swayed by political and economic forces.</p>
<p>&gt; It is like a page from Greek mythology, where Hephestus, the ugly and lame god, became so useful to his peers enchanted by the inventions he forged in his lab under Mount Etna, that Aphrodite—the most desirable goddess on Mt. Olympus—agreed to marry him. Everyone was more or less happy until Ares, the god of war (and therefore the main costumer of Hephestus’ inventions), became interested in Aphrodite. She, in turn, could not resist a god in uniform; so while Hephestus kept toiling at his forge, Ares and Aphrodite gamboled in the bed upstairs. Thus do the claims of war often trump the honor of thinkers.</p>
<p>&gt; One of his favorite sayings was attributed to Albert Einstein to be something to the effect of: a creative scientist is like a detective, but a detective who first must commit the crime that needs to be solved. This explained in part why teachers did not like creative students, no matter how intelligent they were; students are supposed to solve the crimes put before them by their elders, not their own.</p>
<p>&gt; But once he arranged a still-life to draw, Artist B would let the first strokes suggest what the next ones should be; the drawing developed organically–it was discovered rather than re-presented . Type-B artists reported in their interviews that by the time the drawing was well advanced, it took on a life of its own: the artist was solving a problem that had no known precedent, a problem that emerged out of the process itself. In other words, they were like Einstein’s detective who had to commit his own crime before solving it.</p>
<p>&gt; Of course, what Simon did was to transform what historically had been a discovered problem into a presented problem. Tycho Brahe and Friedrich Wöhler had to decide what was the right information necessary to solve planetary motions and the synthesis of urea, respectively; Simon’s software was handed the necessary information and the method for reaching the solution. In so doing, anything resembling creativity was leached out of the process.</p>
<p>&gt; The creativity of a work of art emerges against the background of previous art, which constitutes the domain of art</p>
<p>&gt; In most human endeavors, the opinion of a small elite determines what’s new, what’s not; what is valuable and what is not; what belongs to the domain and what should be excluded from it. This elite is what we call the field</p>
<p>&gt; The only domains that are truly democratic are those in the mass market, where each consumer votes with his or her pocketbook which products will enter the ephemeral domain of products to which they belong.</p>
<p>&gt; What I found particularly suggestive is that the area of the brain most specifically active when improvising, the Dorso-Lateral Pre-Frontal Cortex (or DLPFC for short), is also very active when playing poker. Not chess, but poker. It appears to be where decisions are made when one has insufficient information to reach a rational conclusion.</p>
<p>&gt; Problem situations can be meaningfully distinguished in terms of how much of the problem is clearly given at the start, how much of the method for reaching a solution is already at hand, and how general the agreement is as to what constitutes a good solution.</p>

<p>Este Baggio Café Chocolate Trufado é uma enganação. Vem com aromatizantes artificiais fortes que ficam no estômago o dia inteiro. Vai servir só para doar ou como aromatizante de outros cafés melhores.</p>
<p>PS: Nem pra isso serviu. Acabei doando.</p>

<p>Meu blogue eu já não sei bem o que é, mas eu trabalhei um bom tempo tentando tornar seus posts simples de serem achados. Acho que porque já atingimos a marca de mais de 4000 deles.</p>
<p>Na página inicial existe uma lista com todos os links e páginas. Comece a digitar uma palavra que está contida nesses links e ele aparecerá em uma lista. Selecione o item desejado e digite enter.</p>
<p>Para buscas no conteúdo dos posts você terá que cair em alguma listagem, seja de tags, de meses ou de todos os posts. Eu recomendo você só abrir todos os posts se realmente precisar. São mais de 4000 posts com o início do texto listado, o que requer um certo tempo para carregar em internetes mais lentas (isso no futuro não deve ser um problema).</p>
<p>O bom de uma listagem de tags ou de todos os posts é que você pode ir filtrando a lista aos poucos, digitando um termo seguido de enter, a lista é filtrada e você pode digitar outro termo seguido de enter. Para começar tudo de novo é só digitar enter com o campo vazio. Outra funcionalidade bacana desse tipo de busca é que existe um botão random que navega para uma página aleatória dos itens filtrados, ou de todos se não houver filtro. Por que isso é legal? Porque existe poste pra caralho!</p>
<p>Também rotulo os postes com tags. Elas são úteis para navegação temática. Nem sempre é fácil categorizar minha cabeça, mas de vez em quando eu tento reorganizar tudo de novo. Ainda não sei se vale mais lotar o sistema das tags mais verborrágicas possíveis ou deixá-las minimalistas é o caminho. Talvez eu esteja perdendo a chance de categorizar tudo e mais pro futuro isso se tornar uma ferramenta. Porém, ainda não cheguei em um modelo simples de ser seguido.</p>
<p>Por fim, isso me leva para a questão dos links internos, do índice cruzado e tudo mais. Isso está em construção e os links atuais devem cair na lista de todos os posts com o termo buscado preenchido, o que é um saco. Mas muito útil também quando você precisa compartilhar um link que poderá mudar no futuro.</p>
<p>Mas a ideia final não é essa. A ideia final é que os termos conversem entre si e termos futuros possam ser atingidos por links do passado que nem sabiam que esse dia chegaria. Enquanto não chega ou os posts não foram linkados, o termo não vira um link, ou vira para um failover que cai na mesma página de estamos em obras.</p>
<p>O que finaliza a ideia do blogue: um livro eternamente em obras. Dele devem surgir livros menores, mas melhor indexados e trabalhados na narrativa de alguma mensagem. Veremos. Pode ser que o meu eu do futuro tenha outros planos.</p>
<p>Se você quiser ajudar não vou ligar. Faça um fork, trabalhe e me mande um pulo request. Se caiu aqui por engano… o que está fazendo aqui ainda? Aperte o voltar o fechar do seu navegador. Boas leituras.</p>

<p>I don't really know what my blog is anymore, but I've spent a long time trying to make its posts easy to find. I think that's because we've already reached the milestone of having over 4,000 posts.</p>
<p>On the home page there's a list with all the links and pages. Start typing a word that's contained in these links and it will appear in a list. Select the desired item and press enter.</p>
<p>To search the content of the posts you'll have to go to a list, whether it's tags, months or all posts. I recommend that you only open all the posts if you really need to. There are over 4,000 posts with the beginning of the text listed, which takes a while to load on slower internets (this shouldn't be a problem in the future).</p>
<p>The good thing about a list of tags or all posts is that you can filter the list little by little, by typing a term followed by enter, the list is filtered and you can type another term followed by enter. To start all over again, just press enter with the field empty. Another cool feature of this type of search is that there is a random button that navigates to a random page of filtered items, or all of them if there is no filter. Why is this cool? Because there are so many posts!</p>
<p>I also label posts with tags. They are useful for thematic navigation. It is not always easy to categorize my head, but every now and then I try to reorganize everything again. I still don't know if it is better to fill the system with the most verbose tags possible or to keep them minimalistic. Maybe I am missing the chance to categorize everything and for this to become a tool in the future. However, I have not yet arrived at a simple model to be followed.</p>
<p>Finally, this brings me to the issue of internal links, cross-indexing and everything else. This is under construction and the current links should appear in the list of all posts with the search term filled in, which is a pain. But it is also very useful when you need to share a link that may change in the future.</p>
<p>But that is not the final idea. The final idea is that the terms talk to each other and future terms can be reached by links from the past that didn't even know this day would come. Until it arrives or the posts haven't been linked, the term doesn't become a link, or it becomes a failover that lands on the same page as we're under construction.</p>
<p>Which concludes the idea of the blog: a book eternally under construction. It should produce smaller books, but better indexed and worked on the narrative of some message. We'll see. Maybe my future self has other plans.</p>
<p>If you want to help, I won't mind. Make a fork, work on it and send me a jump request. If you ended up here by mistake... What are you still doing here? Press back or close on your browser. Happy reading.</p>

<p>Após ler [Wired to Eat] entendi muito mais sobre dieta do que gostaria de saber. Com isso eu consigo dar uma pausa em minhas dietas malucas e começar a seguir minha própria intuição.</p>
<p>Em linhas gerais, as regras básicas da alimentação Paleo são muito semelhantes as [Low Carb], como eliminar açúcar e grãos. Porém, é mais simples de lembrar: coma tudo o que os humanos comiam antes da agricultura. Comida de verdade, em outras palavras.</p>
<p>No entanto, seguidores de Paleo costumam ter um cuidado especial com alimentos que grande parte da população é alérgica, como leite e derivados, além do glúten (já eliminado se você cortar grãos). Eu não estou pronto para abdicar de lactose, especialmente fermentada e maturada (queijos em geral).</p>
<p>Na verdade não estou pronto para me privar de nada, mas disposto a mudar a proporção dos alimentos.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Paleo não é bem uma dieta. É mais um estilo de vida que pode e deve ser adotado com uma perspectiva de longo prazo. Quebrar as regras, eventualmente, não prejudica o corpo já adaptado e é muito saudável para a mente. Equilíbrio e bom senso são fundamentais!</p>

<p>Romance fofinho. O cara chama Mr. Darcy de verdade (foi Colin Firth quem protagonizou o personagem de Orgulho e Preconceito na série televisiva britânica, então a piada/referência é válida). Hugh Grant canastrão na medida certa. Direção dinâmica com músicas pop icônicas e um roteiro fluido, onde uma cena puxa a outra e quase não parece montado, exceto por momentos divertidíssimos escolhidos para o filme, como a briga dos rapazes no restaurante grego na frente de casa, ou piadas ruinzinhas que envelheceram mal. Porém, tudo empalidece frente a interpretação de Renée Zellweger, uma atriz texana que adota um sotaque britânico perfeito e polido e demonstra uma energia que transcende o filme que participa. Você veria este filme apenas por causa dela, ainda que não houvesse roteiro. Ela compensa. Ela é real, está a uns quilos a mais da perfeição sempre e seu diário é um mero acúmulo de todas as garotas seduzidas nos escritórios dos anos 2000. Uma ode à garota comum com toques da autora de [Orgulho e Preconceito]. Não é imperdível, mas continua uma sessão que aquece o coração.</p>

<p>Existe um bug que considera slugs como globais, independente do capítulo (mês) em que o post foi escrito. Com isso títulos ou slugs iguais geram o mesmo post na listagem de posts e apenas uma entrada no quicksearch.</p>
<p>É necessário renomear as variáveis do script txt2blog.awk para que fique mais simples de entender onde cada variável é usada. Como na prática todas são globais a ideia é usar os prefixos f_ (função), a_ (argumento), l_ (local) e g_ (global) para conseguir diferenciar. Não sei se existe alguma convenção de nomes para variáveis em scripts awk (se houver, usar).</p>
<p>Apenas após as variáveis renomeadas será possível reescrever o script para permitir a correção deste e outros bugs.</p>

<p>&gt; &quot;Cada problema que eu resolvo se torna uma regra que serve mais tarde para resolver outros problemas.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; Rene Descartes</p>
<p>Hoje usei uma técnica que é bem intuitiva durante o debugging, mas que pode servir para outros cenários de engenharia reversa. </p>
<p>Cansado de tentar entender onde estava a chamada de uma função que fazia um certo app ser ativado por um link peguei o executável responsável para depurar seu assembly.</p>
<p>O programa tem o funcionamento bem simples: ele recebe um argumento  de alguma forma ativa uma instância do aplicativo principal em execução para abrir o link passado como parâmetro.</p>
<p>Para encontrar a chamada da Windows API que faz a coisa acontecer eu poderia passar horas depurando passo a passo até entender a lógica por trás do assembly. No entanto, e aí que está o pulo do gato, eu posso também executar dezenas de vezes e ir “cercando” o ponto onde o app faz a ativação.</p>
<p>Para isso basta ir depurando cada execução até ocorrer a ativação. Quando descobrir que após uma chamada o app é ativado basta salvar este ponto e executar novamente o mesmo comando com este novo ponto em breakpoint. Repita até chegar em uma função API ou alguma thread ou algum comando para uma worker thread (algo muito comum hoje em Windows Apps).</p>
<p>Dependendo da forma com que é implementado isso pode levar de alguns minutos a talvez uma hora ou duas. Mas com certeza será mais rápido que ir todo o código passo a passo.</p>

<p>Lendo um paper sobre relação entre açúcar e o comportamento de vício em outras drogas.</p>
<p>&gt; “Food addiction” seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs.</p>
<p>&gt; The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain circumstances rats can become sugar dependent. This may translate to some human conditions as suggested by the literature on eating disorders and obesity.</p>
<p>&gt; A well-known characteristic of addictive drugs is their ability to cause repeated, intermittent increases in extracellular dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988, Hernandez and Hoebel, 1988, Wise et al., 1995).</p>
<p>&gt; This consequently leads to changes in the expression or availability of DA receptors (Colantuoni et al., 2001, Spangler et al., 2004).</p>
<p>&gt; Animals sensitized to one substance often show cross-sensitization, which is defined as an increased locomotor response to a different drug or substance.</p>
<p>&gt; It is well established that addictive drugs activate DA-containing neurons in areas of the brain that process behavior reinforcement.</p>
<p>&gt; The mesolimbic DA projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the NAc is frequently implicated in reinforcement functions (Wise and Bozarth, 1984). The NAc is important for several components of “reward” including food seeking and reinforcement of learning, incentive motivation, stimulus salience and signaling a stimulus change (Bassareo and Di Chiara, 1999, Berridge and Robinson, 1998, Salamone, 1992, Schultz et al., 1997, Wise, 1988).</p>
<p>&gt; A variety of foods can release DA in the NAc, including lab chow, sugar, saccharin, and corn oil</p>
<p>&gt; Ingestion of palatable foods has effects via endogenous opioids in a variety of sites (Dum et al., 1983, Mercer and Holder, 1997, Tanda and Di Chiara, 1998), and the injection of mu-opioid agonists in the NAc increases intake of palatable foods rich in fat or sugar (Zhang et al., 1998, Zhang and Kelley, 2002). Opioid antagonists, on the other hand, decrease ingestion of sweet food and shorten meals of palatable, preferred foods, even at doses that have no effect on standard chow intake</p>
<p>&gt; Rats fed daily intermittent sugar and chow escalate their sugar intake and increase their intake during the first hour of daily access, which we define as a “binge”</p>
<p>&gt; The animals with ad libitum access to a sugar solution tend to drink it throughout the day, including their inactive period.</p>
<p>&gt; Rats fed Daily Intermittent Sugar and Chow regulate their caloric intake by decreasing their chow intake to compensate for the extra calories obtained from sugar, which results in a normal body weight (Avena, Bocarsly, Rada, Kim and Hoebel, unpublished, Avena et al., 2003b, Colantuoni et al., 2002).</p>

<p>Série recente cujo tema é uma moça que sabe se alguém está dizendo mentiras. Estranhando um dono de cassino pretende usar isso para trapacear uma jogatina privada com câmeras espalhadas pela mesa. Por que usar uma psycho como ela em vez de simplesmente olhar as cartas pelas câmeras eu não sei, mas está de acordo com um roteiro que trabalha seus personagens e suas tramas como se fizessem parte de um vídeo-game de investigação.</p>
<p>A protagonista, por exemplo, encarna uma detetive de jogo no segundo episódio, pois ela vai juntando pistas como em uma fase e você sabe que o final é ela conseguir, então resta apenas acompanhar a historinha manjada, embora bem construída. Lembra um pouco de Scotland Yard, antigo jogo de tabuleiro da Estrela onde pistas aparentemente não-relacionadas eram usadas para descobrir o nome do assassino.</p>
<p>A graça está na atmosfera lúdica das histórias, como contos de um mesmo universo. Além disso, a fotografia é soberba e a direção é primorosa. Quem assina (e dirige, pelo menos os primeiros) é Rian Johnson, o mesmo de ótimos episódios de Breaking Bad, o filme Looper e a melhor continuação de Star Wars (Os Últimos Jedi). Aquele filme Knives Out também é legalzinho, mas não para tanto. O forte de Johnson é controlar a atmosfera. E ele decide que a atmosfera aqui é mais lúdica, menos realista que Breaking Bad, que também se passa no deserto americano, mas é para adultos. Este é mais um girls only com uma leveza para adolescentes. É uma pegada diferente que funciona. Não vá pela trama. Ela é simplista.</p>

<p>Filme jovem, te joga no meio da trama misteriosa de uma só vez, que é manjada, mas tudo bem. A alegoria do paraíso e das cobras chegando de fininho para revelar “a verdade” é inspirada e inspiradora, mas mal desenvolvida. Por outro lado, essa febre hedonista de se sentir bem todos os momentos do dia e usar drogas para manter a experiência de estar vivo interessante é uma verdadeira pérola quando somos jogados para a rotina na ilha de um bilionário gostosão (Channing Tatum) e sua peguete da camada baixa, a interessantíssima enquanto desinteressante (seu forte é desenhar animaizinhos em suas unhas) Frida. Ela está apaixonadinha pelo bilionário (quem não estaria), mas ela vai descobrir (a vá!) que ele não é flor que se cheire.</p>
<p>Há muitos sentidos literais neste filme. O cheiro das flores, o gosto horrível do veneno das serpentes, a comida preparada com requinte, o vinho centenário aberto toda noite. Os sentidos e a perda deles é o que une este grupo inusitado de pessoas em uma experiência que mímica um microcosmos da sociedade simplificada para transmitir uma mensagem pouco polida que se inspira na maestria do terror contemporâneo de Jordan Peele e outros (mas mais Peele). É pouco polida porque a asiática caricata do filme que fica repetindo Red Rabbit é uma mera sombra da construção do personagem de Betty Gabriel como Georgina em Corra!. Uma possui uma razão de ser essencial que a torna estranha. A outra só é estranha porque é isso que espera-se de um filme de suspense dramático.</p>
<p>Mas este é um filme jovem. Não é para pensar (não muito). É mais para curtir o momento, deixar seus sentidos te levarem ao ápice de uma vida boa para perceber que uma hora a conta chega. Hedonista em sua própria estrutura, nos leva a um final irônico e, esse, sim, com camadas, que comentam a consequência dos oprimidos se erguem (virarem opressores, claro), em um delírio tão atraente quando Wakanda ser um milagre tecnológico no meio da selva de primitivos.</p>
<p>Mas penso demais a respeito às vezes, me deixando levar com o que os jovens têm a dizer. Bobo eu. Enfim, é muito bom assistir a uma sessão de cinema de vez em quando.</p>

<p>Muito bom vinho. De boa qualidade. Um dos melhores Merlot que já provei, embora perca fácil para La Revancha. Ele é de uma vinícola de um cara rico supersticioso que deixa tocando cantos gregorianos para seus vinhos descansarem na cava. Quando visitei essa vinícola no Chile junto de outros brasileiros foi um misto de vergonha alheia. Patético. Digno observar que é lá que fica um dos esquecíveis restaurantes de Francis Malaman.</p>

<p>Uvas maceradas e fermentadas com a pele. Descansadas em barricas. Bebi a garrafa número 1.378 e este foi um dos melhores vinhos do ano. Uma surpresa. Seu sabor inesperado de vinho branco com muita personalidade impressionou a mim e a família Incrível. Que vinho! Feito por brasileiros que fundaram uma vinícola em Casablanca, Chile. Espetacular. Bravo! Por mais vinhos assim. Este é, importante lembrar, um experimento do casal, de 2019.</p>

<p>Vinho do sul misturando duas uvas. Uma alemã e outra Argentina. Depois que abri uma garrafa do Bodegas RE e aprendi sobre o Gewurztraminer achei este rótulo no St. Marché e tive que comprar. É um bom vinho, nada demais. Possui mais corpo que os brancos em geral e tem mais tanino graças ao blend e por parte da casca.</p>

<p>Segunda vez que me deparo com a Rio Sol. A primeira foi naquele experimento da Enowine com uma degustação às cegas de 16 pequenas garrafitas sem detalhes do que elas contém. A Rio Sol foi uma das melhores cotadas. Achei sensacional e nem tinha ideia da uva ou da idade. Esta vinícola tem futuro.</p>
<p>O Tempranillo deles é bem gostoso. Mais fácil de tomar que os chilenos e espanhois, mas ainda com bom corpo.</p>
<p>O Blend de Chenin Blanc e Viognier, surpreendentemente requintado, é um pouco mais encorpado para os acostumados com Sauvignon Blanc ou Chardonnay. Considero uma boa bebida para um ambiente mais quente como o Nordeste, de onde essa vinícola é.</p>
<p>Mal espero por um Rio Sol Gran Reserva. Sei que posso me decepcionar forte, mas é sobre isso que você se aventura a degustar inúmeros rótulos nunca se apegando a nenhum. Mas quando vem uma surpresa… que maravilha!</p>

<h2>Salt</h2>
<p>&gt; Though all salt crystals are produced by evaporating water from saltwater brine, the pace of evaporation will determine the shape those crystals take.</p>
<p>&gt; Our taste buds can discern whether or not salt is present, and in what amount. But salt also unlocks many aromatic compounds in foods, making them more readily available as we eat. The simplest way to experience this is to taste an unsalted soup or broth.</p>
<p>&gt; Salt also reduces our perception of bitterness, with the secondary effect of emphasizing other flavors present in bitter dishes.</p>
<p>&gt; The distribution of salt throughout food can be explained by osmosis and diffusion, two chemical processes powered by nature’s tendency to seek equilibrium, or the balanced concentration of solutes such as minerals and sugars on either side of a semipermeable membrane (or holey cell wall). In food, the movement of water across a cell wall from the saltier side to the less salty side is called osmosis. Diffusion , on the other hand, is the often slower process of salt moving from a saltier environment to a less salty one until it’s evenly distributed throughout.</p>
<p>&gt; A small amount of salt applied in advance will make a much bigger difference than a larger amount applied just before serving. In other words, time, not amount, is the crucial variable.</p>
<p>&gt; Because salt also initiates osmosis, and visibly draws water out of nearly any ingredient it touches, many people believe that salt dries and toughens food. But with time, salt will dissolve protein strands into a gel, allowing them to absorb and retain water better as they cook. Water is moisture: its presence makes meat tender and juicy.</p>
<p>&gt; The three most valuable tools to encourage salt diffusion are time, temperature, and water. Before setting out to cook—as you choose an ingredient, or a cooking method—ask yourself, “How can I season this from within?” Then, use these variables to plot out how far in advance—and how much—to salt your food or cooking water.</p>
<p>&gt; The three basic decisions involving salt are: When? How much? In what form? Ask yourself these three questions every time you set out to cook.</p>
<h2>Fat</h2>
<p>&gt; I learned that where olive oil comes from has a huge effect on how it tastes—oil from hot, dry hilly areas is spicy, while oil from coastal climates with milder weather is correspondingly milder in flavor.</p>
<p>&gt; Fat coats the tongue, allowing various aromatic compounds to stay in contact with our taste buds for longer periods of time, intensifying and prolonging our experience of various flavors.</p>
<p>&gt; Take advantage of this capability to intensify and circulate flavor by adding aromatics directly into the cooking fat.</p>
<p>&gt; As with wine, taste, not price, is the best guide to choosing an olive oil. This might require an initial leap of faith, but the only way to learn the vocabulary of olive oil is to taste, and pay attention.</p>
<p>&gt; While it’s a challenge to explain what good olive oil tastes like, it’s fairly simple to describe a bad one—bitter, overwhelmingly spicy, dirty, rancid—all deal-breakers.</p>
<p>&gt; It will go rancid about twelve to fourteen months after it’s been pressed, so don’t save it for a special occasion, thinking it will improve over time like a fine wine!</p>
<p>&gt; Most aromatic molecules are repelled by water, so in meat they’re predominantly found in an animal’s fat.</p>
<p>&gt; As a result, any animal’s fat will taste much more distinctly of that animal than its lean meat—beef fat tastes beefier than steak, pork fat tastes porkier than pork, chicken fat tastes more chickeny than chicken, and so on.</p>
<h3>Bakery and Fat</h3>
<p>&gt; By coating individual gluten strands, fat prevents them from sticking to one another and lengthening.</p>
<p>&gt; Four main variables will determine the texture of any baked good (and some nonbaked ones, such as pasta): fat, water, yeast, and how much the dough or batter is kneaded or worked.</p>
<p>&gt; Butter contains about 15 to 20 percent water by weight. If butter softens and melts as it’s worked into the dough, its emulsion will break, releasing that water. Water droplets will bind with the flour, developing into long gluten strands that will cause the dough’s delicate layers to stick together.</p>
<p>&gt; Gluten development requires water, so this oil barrier significantly inhibits gluten formation, leading to a tender, rather than chewy, texture. As an added bonus, less gluten means more water in the batter, and, ultimately, a moister cake.</p>
<p>&gt; Some classic cakes have no chemical leavening—that is, baking soda or baking powder—and rely entirely on whipped fat for their cloudlike structure.</p>
<p>&gt; Typically, cool room-temperature butter is beaten together with sugar for 4 to 7 minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy. When done correctly, the butter will act as a net, entrapping millions of tiny air bubbles throughout the mixture.</p>
<p>&gt; The key is to work air in slowly, so that many consistently tiny bubbles form and you don’t create too much heat through friction.</p>
<p>&gt; As you mix, monitor the butter’s temperature; remember, butter is an emulsion and if it gets too warm, it will melt and the emulsion will break or it simply won’t be rigid enough to continue trapping air.</p>
<p>&gt; If butter is too cold, air won’t be able to get in—not evenly at least—and the cake won’t rise straight up.</p>
<p>&gt; And if fat isn’t properly aerated, chemical leavening won’t make up for it. Baking soda and powder don’t introduce any new air bubbles into a batter. They simply help expand, via the release of carbon dioxide gas, air bubbles already in place.</p>
<h2>Acid</h2>
<p>&gt; I began to see that the true value of acid is not its pucker, but rather, balance . Acid grants the palate relief, and makes food more appealing by offering contrast.</p>
<p>&gt; Umami is, in fact, the result of flavor compounds called glutamates</p>
<p>&gt; The most familiar glutamate is monosodium glutamate, or MSG, the white powder often generously used in the kitchens of Chinese restaurants to enhance flavor. Though MSG is chemically manufactured, there are also many natural sources of glutamates.</p>
<p>&gt; The best apples for pie aren’t the sweetest, but tart varieties such as Fuji, Honeycrisp, and Sierra Beauty.</p>
<p>&gt; Roasted carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli—or anything that’s developed sweetness from browning—will always appreciate a squeeze of lemon or touch of vinegar. A little will go a long way.</p>
<p>&gt; Since the human body can’t produce certain essential forms of salt, fat, and acid, our palates have evolved to seek these three elements. This results in a universal appeal to food with Salt, Fat, and Acid all in balance, no matter the cuisine.</p>
<p>&gt; I’d expected the vinegar to turn the soup into a sweet-and-sour abomination. Instead, the vinegar acted like a prism, revealing the soup’s nuanced flavors—I could taste the butter and oil, the onions and stock, even the sugar and minerals within the carrots. If blindfolded and quizzed, never in a million years would I have been able to identify vinegar as one of the ingredients. But now, if something I cooked and seasoned ever tasted so dull again, I’d know exactly what was missing.</p>
<p>&gt; Anything that tastes sour is a source of acid.</p>
<p>&gt; Of the five basic tastes, acid makes our mouths water the most. When we eat anything sour, our mouths flood with saliva to balance out the acidity, as it’s dangerous for our teeth.</p>
<p>&gt; I once spent an entire summer making and canning sauce with Early Girl tomatoes from a friend’s farm. Every single batch I made was different from the last—some tomatoes were watery, others were more flavorful. Some were sweet, others were more acidic. Any recipe I might have written for the sauce the first week of the summer would have been completely inaccurate by the last week. And these were all the same variety of tomatoes from the same farm!</p>
<p>&gt; Acid dulls vibrant greens, so wait until the last possible moment to dress salads, mix vinegar into herb salsas, and squeeze lemon over cooked green vegetables such as spinach.</p>
<p>&gt; On the other hand, acid keeps reds and purples vivid. Cabbage, red chard stems, or beets will best retain their color when cooked with anything slightly acidic, such as apples, lemon, or vinegar.</p>
<p>&gt; Raw fruits and vegetables that are susceptible to oxidation , the enzymatic browning that results from exposure to oxygen—sliced apples, artichokes, bananas, and avocados—will retain their natural color if coated with a little acid or kept in water mixed with a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar until they are ready to cook or eat.</p>
<p>&gt; Acid keeps vegetables and legumes tougher, longer. Anything containing cellulose or pectin, including legumes, fruits, and vegetables, will cook much more slowly in the presence of acid. While ten to fifteen minutes of simmering in water is enough to soften carrots into baby food, they’ll still be somewhat firm after an hour of stewing in red wine.</p>
<p>&gt; When cooking beans or any legumes, including the chickpeas for hummus, a pinch of baking soda will gently nudge the bean water away from acidity toward alkalinity , ensuring tenderness. And, just like those onions, cook legumes until they are completely tender before adding anything acidic. A great Mexican chef once told me that dousing cooked beans with vinegar or vinaigrette sort of “uncooks” them, tightening and toughening the skins a bit. Account for that tightening when preparing beans for a salad, and cook the beans just a touch longer than you might otherwise.</p>
<p>&gt; Acid also encourages bonds between pectin groups—the gelling agent in fruit—so that they can trap water to help set jam or jelly. Some fruits, such as apples and blueberries, don’t contain enough acid to bond the pectin on their own, so we help them along by squeezing some fresh lemon juice into the jam pot and into fruit fillings for pies and cobblers to encourage them to set.</p>
<p>&gt; Doughs and batters leavened by baking soda should also have an acidic ingredient such as natural cocoa powder, brown sugar, honey, or buttermilk. Baking powder, on the other hand, already contains powdered tartaric acid and doesn’t need an external source of acid to react.</p>
<p>&gt; Under normal conditions, strands of egg proteins unravel and tighten when heated. As they do, the strands squeeze out water, causing eggs to toughen and dry out. Acid draws egg proteins together before they can unravel, which inhibits them from joining too closely. A few secret drops of lemon juice will produce creamier, more tender scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>&gt; Acid aids in stabilizing whipped egg whites by encouraging more, finer air pockets, helping to increase the volume of the egg white foam.</p>
<p>&gt; Dairy proteins called casein will coagulate, or curdle, with the addition of acid. With the exception of butter and heavy cream, which are very low in protein, dairy should only be added to acidic dishes at the last minute.</p>
<p>&gt; When acid is incorporated into doughs and batters, it will tenderize them, much as fat does. Whether it comes in the form of cultured dairy, natural (nonalkalized) cocoa powder, or vinegar, acid in a dough or a batter will disrupt the gluten network, resulting in a more tender product. If it’s chewiness you’re after, wait as long as possible into the process of dough-making to add acidic ingredients.</p>
<p>&gt; Acid tenderizes, then toughens, meat and fish proteins. Imagine protein as coiled strands folded up into bundles. When acid comes into contact with the coils, they unfold and unwind. This process is called denaturation . These denatured proteins then begin to bump into each other and coagulate , reconnecting into an intimate network. The same thing happens when proteins are heated, which is why acid is sometimes said to cook meat or fish.</p>
<p>&gt; At first, the intimate network traps water that was previously bound up in muscle fibers, leading to moist, tender food. But if the denaturation conditions persist—that is, if food continues to sit in acid—the protein network will continue to tighten, squeezing water out of the protein altogether, resulting in tough, dry food, much like an overcooked steak.</p>
<p>&gt; To understand this progression, consider the way the texture of a piece of sashimi will become tender, bright-tasting fish tartare with the addition of acid, and then turn into a chewy ceviche over time.</p>
<p>&gt; Fish meant for cooking shouldn’t marinate in acid for more than a few minutes, but dip any flaky, white-fleshed fish into buttermilk and flour before frying, or toss sea bass with lemon juice and curry powder just before skewering and grilling, and you’ll get the benefit of moist texture along with the pleasant hit of tartness.</p>
<p>&gt; While we introduce salt and fat into our food in the form of distinct ingredients, there are two easy ways to produce acid in food as we cook. One process is rather fast, the other rather slow. The fast method? Browning foods.</p>
<p>&gt; The chemical reaction involved in browning sugars is called caramelization . The chemical reaction involved in browning meats, seafood, vegetables, baked goods, or just about anything else is called the Maillard reaction , after Louis-Camille Maillard, the scientist who discovered it.</p>
<p>&gt; Though they’re entirely different processes, caramelization and the Maillard reaction share some similarities. Both create acidic flavor compounds, in addition to many other tasty molecules, as by-products. As it caramelizes, a single sugar molecule will develop into hundreds of new and different compounds, including some acids.</p>
<p>&gt; Though producing acidity is rarely a reason to brown food, knowing that the process will develop a host of new flavors, including some sour ones, can be a valuable tool.</p>
<p>&gt; The other, much slower, method for producing acid in the kitchen is fermentation , where, in addition to many other flavor-producing processes, carbohydrates transform into carbon dioxide and acids or alcohols using yeasts, bacteria, or a combination thereof. Wine, beer, and cider are of course fermented, but so are naturally leavened breads, all sorts of pickles, cured meats, cultured dairy, and even coffee and chocolate.</p>
<p>&gt; According to Chad Robertson, of Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, who lets his dough rise for more than thirty hours, slow fermentation “improves the flavor, in large part because more sugars are available to caramelize during the baking. The loaves brown faster and the crust gets darker.”</p>
<p>&gt; Cooking acids tend to be mellow, transforming the foods with which they are cooked slowly, over time.</p>
<p>&gt; While no amount of salt at the table will make up for underseasoning food from within, a hit of acid at the very last second often improves food, which is why garnishing acids are so important</p>
<p>&gt; The application of heat will change the flavors of both citrus juice and vinegar, dulling the former and mellowing the latter, so add them just before serving when you want their full flavor impact.</p>
<p>&gt; Sauce, and in fact most condiments, are sources of both acid and salt, they offer a pretty surefire way to improve flavor.</p>
<p>&gt; A little ketchup—and the umami it offers—makes things taste inexplicably more delicious.</p>
<p>&gt; Chocolate and coffee are the perfect bases for building desserts because they are bitter, sour, and rich in umami.</p>
<p>&gt; Always balance sweetness with acid, and not only in desserts. Roasted beets, full of sugar, benefit from a splash of red wine vinegar, which offers contrast to the naturally earthy flavor of beets that is so off-putting to some.</p>
<p>&gt; a salad should relieve your palate and leave it clean after rich, muddy foods.</p>
<p>&gt; Though each dish, on its own, should always be balanced in Salt, Fat, and Acid, there is also the larger picture to consider—a good meal should also be balanced.</p>
<p>&gt; Play to each element’s strengths: use Salt to enhance, Fat to carry, and Acid to balance flavor. Now, with the knowledge of how they affect various foods, add each to a dish at the right time in order to season it from within.</p>
<p>&gt; Cook every single day. Taste everything thoughtfully. Go to the farmers’ market and familiarize yourself with each season’s produce.</p>
<h2>Heat</h2>
<p>&gt; As I traveled, I noticed that in every country, whether I was watching home cooks or professional chefs, and whether they were cooking over live fire or on a camp stove, the best cooks looked at the food, not the heat source</p>
<p>&gt; Once familiar with how different foods respond to heat, you’ll make better choices about how to shop at the market, plan a menu, and cook every dish.</p>
<p>&gt; Just as I learned from watching cooks all around the world, no matter what you’re cooking, or what heat source you’re using, the aim is always the same: apply heat at the right level, and at the right rate, so that the surface of a food and its interior are done cooking at the same time.</p>
<p>&gt; Food is primarily made up of four basic types of molecules: water, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.</p>
<p>&gt; Water, fat, carbohydrate, and protein molecules each react to heat in different, yet predictable, ways.</p>
<p>&gt; Water is an essential element of practically all foods. Cook most of its water out, and food will become crisp or dry. Leave its water in—or add water as you cook—to make food moist and tender.</p>
<p>&gt; When frozen, water expands. This is why you must always leave headroom in jars of soup or stock you plan to freeze. Or why a bottle of beer or wine you stick in the freezer to chill will explode if forgotten. On a much, much tinier scale—at the cellular level—a similar phenomenon occurs inside foods: as food freezes, its cell walls, much like your storage containers, will burst when the water they contain expands.</p>
<p>&gt; Freezer burn and dehydration, then, are the result of water escaping from the inside of a food’s cells and then crystallizing or vaporizing on the surface of the food. Have you ever opened a package of frozen berries or meat and wondered where those Antarctic stalactites came from? Now you know—from inside your food.</p>
<p>&gt; To be on the safe side, when reheating soupy leftovers or your freezer stash of chicken stock, make sure to bring them to a boil to kill bacteria that may have grown in the meantime.</p>
<p>&gt; Let the sight of steam help you approximate temperature: as long as food is wet and giving off steam, its surface temperature probably isn’t hot enough to allow browning to begin. Remember, the reactions that cause food to brown—caramelization and the Maillard reaction—don’t begin until food reaches much higher temperatures. So, if water is present on the surface of a food, it can’t brown.</p>
<p>&gt; Contain and recycle steam with a lid to allow food to cook in a moist environment if you want to prevent or delay browning.</p>
<p>&gt; Food piled up in a pan can affect steam levels in a pan by acting like a makeshift lid: both entrap steam. Trapped steam condenses and drips back down, keeping food moist and maintaining the temperature right around 212°F.</p>
<p>&gt; Steam replaces some of the air contained in vegetables with water, which is why plants initially transform from opaque to translucent in color and reduce in volume as they cook.</p>
<p>&gt; How tightly a sheet pan of vegetables is packed is as much of a factor in even browning as the oven temperature. Let zucchini and peppers develop glorious sweetness and flavor by spreading them out so steam can escape and browning can begin sooner. Protect denser vegetables that take longer to cook, such as artichokes or cipollini onions, from browning too much before they can cook through by packing them tightly in a pan to entrap steam.</p>
<p>&gt; And the taller the sides of the pan or pot, the longer it will take steam to escape. Deep pots and pans are great for sweating onions and simmering soups, but less ideal for foods you aim to sear and brown quickly, such as scallops and steaks.</p>
<p>&gt; When the goal is to brown swiftly, wait to salt food until after it begins to crisp or salt far enough in advance to let osmosis occur, pat food dry, and then place into a hot pan. Use the former method for onions you want to sweat and keep translucent for cauliflower soup, and the latter for eggplant and zucchini you plan to grill or roast.</p>
<p>&gt; At moderate temperatures, fat is an ideal gentle cooking medium, perfect for using in a cooking method called confit , which is essentially poaching in fat instead of water. Look ahead to recipes for Tomato , Tuna , and Chicken Confit to put this technique into practice.</p>
<p>&gt; While water boils and vaporizes at 212°F, fats can climb to staggering temperatures well beyond that point before turning to smoke. As a result, since water and fat don’t mix, foods containing water (which is practically all foods) won’t dissolve in fat; instead the surfaces of foods exposed to very hot fats can climb to high enough temperatures to develop crisp textures as water evaporates.</p>
<p>&gt; If the fat gets too hot, just turn off the heat or carefully add a little more room-temperature oil. If the pot gets too cold, increase the heat and wait before adding more food. The same phenomenon will cause meats with large quantities of fat such as prime rib or pork loin roasts (or those sitting in fat, such as any of the confits mentioned above) to continue cooking slowly even when pulled from the heat.</p>
<p>&gt; Found primarily in foods made from plant sources, carbohydrates provide food with both structure and flavor. In Acid, I described three types of carbohydrates—cellulose, sugars, and pectin. Along with a fourth type of carbohydrate—starches—cellulose provides much of the bulk and texture of plant-derived foods, while sugars offer flavor.</p>
<p>&gt; When heated, carbohydrates generally absorb water and break down.</p>
<p>&gt; If fibrous or stringy is a word that comes to mind when you think of a particular fruit or vegetable, it’s rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate that isn’t broken down by heat. Cook cellulose-rich produce, such as collard greens, asparagus, or artichokes, until it absorbs enough water to become tender.</p>
<p>&gt; Leaves have less cellulose fibers than stems or stalks, which is why kale and chard stems cook at a different rate than their leaves and ought to be stemmed and cooked separately, or simply staggered into the pot.</p>
<p>&gt; Give the starchiest parts of plants, including tubers such as potatoes and seeds such as dried beans, plenty of water and time over gentle heat to coax out their tenderness. Starches absorb liquid and swell or break down, so firm potatoes become delightfully creamy, impossibly hard chickpeas transform into buttery bites, and rice goes from indigestible to fluffy and tender.</p>
<p>&gt; Dry seeds, grains, and legumes, including rice, beans, barley, chickpeas, and wheatberries, generally need water and heat to make them edible. To protect the potential for life that they contain, seeds have evolved with tough sheaths that make them nearly impossible for us to digest unless we transform them in some way.</p>
<p>&gt; Sometimes, this simply means removing the shell, as we do with sunflower and pumpkin seeds.</p>
<p>&gt; For seeds that need to be cooked in order to become edible, this usually means adding water and heating them until they grow tender. Some starch-rich seeds, including dried shell beans, chickpeas, and hearty grains like barley benefit from an overnight soak, which gives them a head start at absorbing water. Consider it a sort of inactive cooking.</p>
<p>&gt; Without that tough exterior, processed grains cook much more quickly and have a longer shelf-life than their whole-grain counterparts.</p>
<p>&gt; The key to cooking starches properly is using the correct amount of water and heat.</p>
<p>&gt; Odorless and colorless, sucrose , or sugar is the pure manifestation of sweetness. When exposed to heat, it melts.</p>
<p>&gt; At extremely high temperatures (340°F), sugar molecules begin to darken in color, in a process that isn’t entirely understood, as they decompose and reorganize into hundreds of new compounds, generating abundant new flavors. This is caramelization , and it’s one of the most essential ways heat affects flavor.</p>
<p>&gt; In addition to starches that can be broken down into sugars, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and some grains also contain natural simple sugars that can participate in the same reactions as table sugar when cooked.</p>
<p>&gt; The small amounts of sugars that most vegetables contain begin to disappear the moment they’re picked, which is why just-picked produce is so much more sweet and flavorful than store-bought.</p>
<p>&gt; Fry newly dug potatoes, full of sugar, and they’ll burn before they can cook through. Instead, when making potato chips or fries, use starchy, older potatoes and rinse them of excess starches after slicing until the water runs clear. Only then will your fried potatoes emerge from hot oil of the fry pot crisp but not burnt.</p>
<p>&gt; It helps me to picture proteins as coiled threads floating around in water. This definition proves particularly useful when visualizing how temperature affects proteins. As with acid, when exposed to heat, the threads first denature , or unwind, and then clump together more tightly, or coagulate , entrapping pockets of water, to create structure in foods.</p>
<p>&gt; Think of how heat transforms a chicken breast from flabby and watery to firm, tender, and moist when perfectly cooked.</p>
<p>&gt; But apply too much heat and the protein clumps will continue to tighten, squeezing out the pockets of water.</p>
<p>&gt; Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season them with salt and a few drops of lemon juice, whisking thoroughly to break them up. Gently melt a little butter in a saucepan over the lowest possible heat and pour in the eggs. Continue to stir with a whisk or a fork, while adding 4 or more tablespoons of butter in thumb-size pieces, letting each be absorbed before you add the next. Never stop stirring, and be patient. It’ll take several minutes for the eggs to start to come together. When they do, pull them from the stove in anticipation of the cooking that will continue due to residual heat. Serve with—what else?—buttered toast.</p>
<p>&gt; A little salt can help keep proteins from drying out. Recall the many advantages of salting meat in advance. One of its luckiest consequences is that, given enough time, salt will tinker with the structure of meat proteins, reducing their capacity to expel water.</p>
<p>&gt; Consequently, meat that has been salted early will be indescribably moist when cooked properly, and even forgive being slightly overcooked</p>
<p>&gt; Preserve tender cuts of meat with careful, quick cooking, generally over the intense heat of a grill, preheated frying pan, or hot oven.</p>
<p>&gt; The key to this transformation is gentle heat. In contrast to the carefully applied quick heat required to cook tender cuts, time and sustained low heat are essential to transforming dark meat’s tough, sinewy connective tissue into luxurious gelatin while its lumps of intermuscular fat render and baste the meat from within.</p>
<p>&gt; Continue heating proteins in the presence of carbohydrates, and a remarkable thing happens: the Maillard reaction , heat’s most significant contribution to flavor</p>
<p>&gt; Use intense heat to brown the surface of meats and quickly cook tender cuts such as steaks and chops through. After browning a tougher cut such as brisket, on the other hand, use gentle heat to keep its interior from drying out.</p>
<p>&gt; Or do the opposite and cook it through with gentle heat. Then, once the meat is tender, increase temperatures to brown the surface.</p>
<p>&gt; Browning is an invaluable flavoring technique, but it must be done with care. Heat that’s uneven or too powerful can take food straight past golden delicious to charred. But sear a steak too timidly, and you’ll overcook it before it has a chance to brown.</p>
<p>&gt; Learn to take browning fearlessly to the edge, because that’s where the deepest flavors lie.</p>
<p>&gt; The same food will cook evenly or unevenly, quickly or slowly, depending on its temperature at the start of cooking. This is particularly true for meat, eggs, and dairy, whose temperamental proteins and fats are deeply affected by temperature swings.</p>
<p>&gt; Because the chicken is so much more dense than the hot oven air, the twenty-five-degree difference in the temperature of the bird when you start cooking it—the approximate differentce between fridge and room temperature—is substantially more important than a twenty-five-degree difference in oven temperature.</p>
<p>&gt; Let all meats—except for the thinnest cuts—come to room temperature before you cook them. The larger the roast, the earlier you can pull it out of the fridge.</p>
<p>&gt; Get in the habit of pulling out the meat you plan to cook for dinner right when you get home from work (and salting it, too, if you haven’t already), and you’ll learn that time can do some of the work of good cooking even better than the oven can.</p>
<p>&gt; Proteins in particular are susceptible to carryover —continued cooking that results from residual heat trapped within a food. Use this knowledge to your advantage, knowing that roasts carry over five to ten degrees Fahrenheit on average after they are removed from heat, and that some vegetables, such as asparagus, do too, as well as fish, shellfish, and custards.</p>
<p>&gt; Many of food’s most aromatic molecules are volatile , meaning that they can evaporate into the surrounding air. The more of a food’s aromatic molecules we can breathe in, the more powerful our experience of its flavor will be.</p>
<p>&gt; Or try a bite of cheese straight from the fridge. It won’t taste like much. Let the cheese come to room temperature. As it warms, its fat molecules relax, releasing entrapped flavor compounds. Taste the cheese again, and you’ll perceive new dimensions of flavor that weren’t available before.</p>
<p>&gt; Volatile compounds in some fruits, such as tomatoes, are so delicate that the cold of the refrigerator can make them less available—making a good case for storing and eating them at room temperature.</p>
<p>&gt; Researchers posit that excessive heat impairs our ability to enjoy the flavor of food. Besides burning our taste buds, hot food is harder to taste. The perception of taste decreases when a food’s temperature rises beyond 95°F. While some foods, such as many pasta dishes and fried fish, suffer if they’re not served immediately after coming out of the pan, most others are more forgiving.</p>
<p>&gt; Most of smoke’s flavor is in its aroma, and it’s one that triggers ancestral memories of the earliest kind of cooking: over fire.</p>
<p>&gt; Heat transforms the flavors of wood into the marvelous flavors of smoke, which include aromatic compounds similar to those found in vanilla and cloves.</p>
<p>&gt; When food is exposed to smoke, it absorbs the sweet, fruity, caramel, flowery, and bready flavor compounds. You’ll see—nothing else compares to the flavor of true wood smoke.</p>
<p>&gt; The easiest way to determine which level of heat to apply is to consider tenderness. For some foods, the goal is creating tenderness, while for others, it’s preserving innate tenderness.</p>
<p>&gt; Foods that start out tough or dry and need to be hydrated or transformed to become tender—grains and starches, tough meats, dense vegetables—will benefit from longer, more gentle cooking.</p>
<p>&gt; When you read recipes, think of temperatures and cooking times as strong suggestions, rather than fixed rules. Set your timer for a few minutes less than a recipe might suggest, then use all of your senses to check for doneness. Always remember the qualities you seek in your food. Adjust course constantly and accordingly to achieve them. This is what good cooking looks like.</p>
<p>&gt; Gentle Cooking Methods: Simmering, Coddling, and Poaching, Steaming, Stewing and Braising, Confit, Sweating, Bain-marie, Low-heat Baking and Dehydrating, Slow-roasting, Grilling, and Smoking.</p>
<p>&gt; Intense Cooking Methods: Blanching, Boiling, and Reducing, Sautéing, Pan-frying, and Shallow and Deep frying, Searing, Grilling and Broiling, High-heat Baking, Toasting, Roasting.</p>
<p>&gt; Since simmering water is gentler than boiling water, it won’t jostle delicate foods so much that they fall apart or agitate tougher foods so much that overcook on the surface before cooking through completely.</p>
<p>&gt; Depending on whom you ask, the temperature of simmering water can range from 180°F to 205°F.</p>
<p>&gt; Look at the pot—is it barely bubbling like a just-poured glass of your favorite sparkling water, beer, or champagne? If so, then cheers—it’s simmering.</p>
<p>&gt; Cuts of meat with lots of connective tissue, such as chicken thighs, brisket, and pork shoulder are perfect for simmering, as the water and gentle heat will transform collagen into gelatin overtime without drying out the exterior</p>
<p>&gt; How to know when the meat is done? It’ll be falling off the bone, or if boneless, it’ll be mouthwateringly tender.</p>
<p>&gt; Starchy carbohydrates prosper at a simmer, which rattles their tough skins and encourages water to flow inside. Simmer potatoes, beans, rice, and all manner of grains until they’ve absorbed enough water to be tender.</p>
<p>&gt; As with boiled meat, heighten the flavor of any starch by simmering it in a savory cooking liquid.</p>
<p>&gt; Porridges, including polenta, grits, and oatmeal, are variations on this theme—simmer these starches in water, milk, or whey, the clear liquid that gathers atop yogurt, until they grow tender</p>
<p>&gt; Make risotto with arborio rice, a variety with a remarkable capacity to absorb an immense amount of liquid without falling apart. After toasting the onions and browning the rice in fat, add flavorful liquids, such as wine, stock, or tomatoes. As the pot simmers, the rice takes on liquid and gives off starch. The more flavorful the liquid, the more flavorful the finished dish will be.</p>
<p>&gt; Fideus , a similar dish from Spain, is made with toasted noodles instead of rice.</p>
<p>&gt; Paella, too, is built on the concept of a thirsty starch drinking up a flavorful stock.</p>
<p>&gt; one of my favorite tricks is to pull the noodles from the boiling water a minute or two early and let them finish cooking in a pan of simmering</p>
<p>&gt; Pasta will also absorb flavorful liquids. As I described in the walkthrough for Pasta alle Vongole , one of my favorite tricks is to pull the noodles from the boiling water a minute or two early and let them finish cooking in a pan of simmering sauce. This allows the noodles and the sauce to unify into a single entity—as the pasta cooks, it gives off starch and takes on liquid.</p>
<p>&gt; Simmer fibrous or tough vegetables—those particularly rich in cellulose—that require extended cooking to be rendered edible.</p>
<p>&gt; If simmering water resembles a glass of champagne, then the water for poaching and coddling should look like a glass of champagne you poured last night but (somehow!) forgot to drink.</p>
<p>&gt; The extra-gentle heat of water used for coddling and poaching is perfect for delicate proteins—eggs, fish, shellfish, and tender meats.</p>
<p>&gt; A bain-marie, or water bath, will help expand the narrow margin of error for cooking curds, custards, bread puddings, and soufflés, and for other delicate tasks such as melting chocolate.</p>
<p>&gt; The gentle heat of a bain-marie is also handy for keeping starchy or temperamental cooked foods such as mashed potatoes, creamy soups, hot chocolate, and gravy warm until serving, without the risk of burning them.</p>
<p>&gt; Indeed, the key to any good stew or braise is the passage of time. Though investing time in cooking—or in anything—can turn some of us off from the endeavor, with braises the investment requires little of us but delivers big results.</p>
<p>&gt; The difference between the two methods is minor: braises involve larger pieces of meat—often on the bone—and minimal cooking liquid, while stews are made with smaller pieces of meat cooked with chunky vegetables, typically served together in the plentiful cooking liquid. Greens, dense vegetables, stone fruits, and tofu also lend themselves well to braising.</p>
<p>&gt; Use the chart of aromatic flavor bases from around the world to determine what vegetables and herbs you’d like to use, and refer to The World of Flavor to choose your flavorings.</p>
<p>&gt; Think of these long-cooked dishes as opportunities to layer in flavor. Every step of the way, consider how to infuse the most flavor into the dish and extract the deepest flavor out of every individual ingredient. Apply the principles of braising and stewing to any tough cut of meat. To preserve flavor, leave the meat in large pieces and on the bone when possible. And remember to season the meat in advance to let salt do its important work of flavoring from within.</p>
<p>&gt; Make sure none of the pieces touch, to encourage steam to escape and to allow for even browning.</p>
<p>&gt; The keys to beautiful, even browning are steady heat and patience. If you move the meat around too often, or just keep picking it up to check on it, it will take an absurdly long time to brown. Resist that urge, and instead work on the aromatic flavor base.</p>
<p>&gt; If so much fat renders from the meat that instead of searing the meat begins to fry, remove the meat from the pan and carefully pour some of the hot fat into a metal bowl and set aside.</p>
<p>&gt; When you’ve finished browning the meat, dump out any remaining fat and deglaze the pan with your liquid of choice, be it stock or water. Remember, this is an ideal moment to work in a cooking acid, so consider adding some wine or beer.</p>
<p>&gt; Top off with more water or stock to come up about a third or halfway up the meat—any more and you’ll be poaching rather than braising.</p>
<p>&gt; Seal the pan with a lid, or parchment paper and foil, and bring everything to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.</p>
<p>&gt; I soon learned that the meat should fall off the bone at the gentlest touch. In boneless braises, meat should be fork-tender. Pull the pan from the heat and let it cool before straining the cooking liquid. Pass the solids through a food mill for a thicker sauce, and taste it and decide if you’d like to reduce it to intensify flavor before adding any salt.</p>
<p>&gt; These techniques are ideal for preparing food in advance. Time performs a potent alchemy on cooked braises and stews, improving flavor with a day or two of rest. Because it liberates the cook from last-minute demands, this kind of cooking is ideal for dinner parties. Braises and stews make for excellent leftovers and freeze well, too. With its basic technique, braising can be the most effortless path toward deeply flavorful food.</p>
<p>&gt; Instead of bothering with an ice bath, simply cook your vegetables a little less, knowing that they’ll continue to cook even after they’re pulled from the pot.</p>
<p>&gt; Confit is the French word for foods cooked slowly in fat at temperatures low enough to avoid browning.</p>
<p>&gt; Sweating is a gentle way of cooking vegetables in minimal fat until they are tender and translucent, without resulting in browning. As they cook, they release some liquid, hence the name. Mirepoix , the aromatic combination of onions, carrots, and celery at the root of all French cooking, is typically sweated, rather than sautéed or browned, in an effort to prevent coloring.</p>
<p>&gt; To keep temperatures in the sweat zone, watch the pan closely. Add salt to draw water out of the vegetables. Use a pan or pot with tall sides to discourage steam from escaping. Parchment paper or a lid will help entrap and recycle steam, if needed. And don’t hesitate to add a splash of water from time to time if you sense a brown spot starting to form.</p>
<p>&gt; A note on stirring: it tends to dissipate heat. So, stir regularly when you want to keep food from browning, and stir less often to let browning take its course.</p>
<p>&gt; Proteins in particular will stick to the pan as they begin to cook.</p>
<p>&gt; Always resist overcrowding the pan and moving food around too much, too soon. Proteins in particular will stick to the pan as they begin to cook. Leave fish, chicken, and meat be for a few minutes, and once they begin to brown, they will release from the pan.</p>
<p>&gt; The term sauté is derived from the French word for “jump,” and it refers to the little jag of the wrist used to flip all of the food in a pan.</p>
<p>&gt; Add chicken thighs to oil at about 365°F to get that desired crust, but let the temperature drop to 325°F, where they can cook through without burning.</p>
<p>&gt; When the temperature is hot enough, food sizzles and browns—but not too violently or quickly—upon entering the pot. When the bubbling ceases and steam slows down, batter is done cooking. When food is crisp and golden, it’s ready to pull from the oil.</p>
<p>&gt; When browning, frying, or searing, the first side of a food to be browned will always be the most beautiful, so lay food in a pan or on the grill with its presentation side down.</p>
<p>&gt; The purpose of searing isn’t so much to cook as it is to brown meat or seafood in order to get the flavor benefits of the Maillard reaction.</p>
<p>&gt; The number one rule of grilling : never cook directly over the flame. Flames leave soot, unpleasant flavors, and carcinogens on food.</p>
<p>&gt; To achieve the most powerful oven spring, leave the oven door shut for the first 15 to 20 minutes of high-heat baking. After the proteins in the dough have set and the basic structure has formed, you can turn down the heat to prevent burning and ensure that the food cooks through.</p>
<p>&gt; Slow-Roasting, Grilling, and Smoking (200° to 300°F)</p>
<p>&gt; The difference between roasting and toasting is simple: toasting implies browning the surface of a food, while roasting also cooks food through.</p>
<p>&gt; Originally, roasting referred to cooking meat on a spit above or beside a fire. What we think of as roasting today—cooking meat in a dry, hot oven—was known as baking until about two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>&gt; The radiant heat emitted from the heating element dries out exposed foods as it cooks them, leading to crisp, dry skin on a chicken, or wrinkly, leathery skin on little potatoes.</p>
<p>&gt; In a convection oven, one or two fans consistently circulate hot air, so food browns, dries out, and cooks more quickly than in a conventional oven.</p>
<p>&gt; Oven browning gains momentum, so start food that must brown quickly at high temperatures and then turn the oven down as browning begins, to prevent overcooking.</p>
<p>&gt; Thin foods, or foods that can’t risk being overcooked before they brown, can benefit from a head start: preheat the baking sheet in the oven before adding oiled and salted zucchini slices,</p>
<p>&gt; If you sense browning is happening too quickly, turn down the temperature, loosely cover the dish with a piece of parchment paper or foil, and move the rack away from the heating element. If you sense browning is happening too slowly, crank up the temperature, push food back into your oven’s hot spots, which are typically the back corners, and move it closer to the heating element.</p>
<p>&gt; For even browning, don’t pack too many vegetables on a tray. Leave space between the pieces for steam to escape and allow temperatures to rise high enough for browning to begin. Tend to your vegetables as they roast—stir them, turn them, rotate trays, and change the oven racks.</p>
<p>&gt; Learn to break down the cooking process into chunks so that you can finish cooking delicate things at the time of serving, preventing the inevitable overcooking associated with reheating. This is exactly the kind of thinking restaurant cooks employ to cut down on the time it takes to prepare a dish to order without compromising quality. Foods that require long exposure to gentle heat—tough meats, dense vegetables, and hearty grains—are entirely or partially cooked in advance and reheated to order. Delicate foods that will cook quickly or suffer from reheating—fried foods, tender meats, fish and shellfish, and baby vegetables—are cooked to order.</p>
<p>&gt; Braise pork shoulder overnight, but grill it up for tacos for a party the next day. To achieve depth of flavor, gently roast or blanch any number of tough vegetables—broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, or winter squash—before sautéing them. Simmer chicken thighs until they’re falling off the bone, then shred the meat to use in a pot pie. Learn to combine two different cooking methods to get the flavor and texture contrasts that so please our palates—such as crisp, brown crusts and soft, tender insides.</p>
<p>&gt; Gauge deep-fried foods not only by their surface color but also by the rate of bubbles they’re giving off. As deep-fried foods cook further, they emit fewer bubbles because there is less moisture left to escape from the food.</p>
<p>&gt; When properly cooked, chicken meat turns from pink to opaque but is still juicy. You can always nick and peek at poultry, meat, or fish. Cut into the thickest part of the piece and see if it’s cooked. Roast chicken is done when pricked at the thigh and the juice runs clear.</p>
<p>&gt; Spices toasting in a hot pan will often emit an aroma long before they change in color, which is a good sign to take them off and let residual heat continue to do its work.</p>
<p>&gt; Tender meats firm up as they cook. • Tough meats also firm up as they cook, but they won’t be done until they relax again, and fall apart at the touch or are tender at the bone.</p>
<h2>Follow Up</h2>
<p>&gt; Now for the fun part: using Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat to compose great dishes and menus. Answer the basic questions for each element to give yourself the clearest idea of how to proceed. How much Salt, Fat, and Acid, and when, and in what forms? Will the ingredients benefit most from gentle or intense Heat? Line up the answers to these questions and a theme will emerge, upon which you can begin to improvise.</p>
<p>&gt; If food doesn’t taste right—first turn to the lessons of Salt, Fat, and Acid. Make sure that those three elements are in balance. Most often, that’ll be enough. If a dish still needs something, turn next to umami. Is it falling a little flat? Perhaps a little soy sauce, pounded anchovy, or Parmesan will make the difference. Finally, texture. Is the reason for the dullness its one-note texture? Perhaps it needs the crunch of bread crumbs, toasted nuts, or a pickle to add contrast.</p>
<p>&gt; Scientists have found that we all prefer to eat foods that engage our senses with these kinds of contrasts—including light and dark, sweet and salty, crunchy and silky, hot and cold, and, of course, sweet and sour. And then there are herbs and spices, which can wake up the plainest foods. Herb salsas, pepper sauces, a sprinkle of chopped parsley, Lebanese za’atar , or Japanese shichimi togarashi can enliven any dish.</p>
<p>&gt; But recipes lead us to believe that cooking is a linear process, while most good food results from a circular one; like a spiderweb, touch one part and the entire thing will quiver.</p>
<p>&gt; Certain kinds of recipes—particularly those involving desserts—must be followed to the letter. But I believe that most savory recipes are little more than guides, and some guides are better than others. Learn to decipher the secret codes within recipes to see where they are leading you.</p>
<p>&gt; When making a dish for the first time, read several different recipes for the same dish and compare notes. Notice which ingredients, techniques, and flavorings are common to the recipes, and which are different. This will give you an idea of which aspects of the dish you must not compromise on, and where a little improvisation is welcome. Over time, as you get to know which chefs and writers are traditionalists, and which take more liberties, you’ll grow better equipped to decide between recipes and cooking styles.</p>
<p>&gt; A baking sheet lined with parchment paper is the ideal landing pad for blanched vegetables, browned meats, cooked grains, or anything else that needs to cool off quickly without overcooking.</p>
<p>&gt; For inspiration, look to salads such as Wedge, Caesar, and Cobb, which remain classics precisely because they achieve this ideal balance of tastes and textures.</p>
<p>&gt; If stock boils, its bubbles will recirculate fat that rises to the top of the stock.</p>
<p>&gt; With the sustained heat and agitation, the stock will emulsify. This is one of the times you’re not looking for an emulsion, because beyond looking cloudy, emulsified stock also tastes cloudy and clings to the tongue in an unpleasant way. One of the best things about good stock is that though its flavor is rich, it’s also clean.</p>

<h2>Leitura em português</h2>
<p>&gt; Qualquer leguminosa, e não somente grão-de-bico, pode se transformar numa pasta semelhante ao homus simplesmente fazendo um purê com grande quantidade de azeite, alho, ervas, pimenta, sumo de limão e, se gostar, tahine. Ajuste o sal e o ácido e sirva com torradas, pão ou coma de colherada, como eu faço.</p>
<p>&gt; O molho estará pronto quando o gosto mudar de cru para cozido, cerca de 25 minutos. Mergulhando a colher no molho, você vai se lembrar menos da feira e mais de um prato de macarrão.</p>
<p>&gt; Cortes mais duros, ricos em tecido conjuntivo e tendões, requerem uma abordagem mais delicada nas nuances culinárias para revelar sua maciez: daí o investimento no fogo baixo e o tempo e a água implícitos no cozimento de um ensopado ou guisado. O calor modifica o colágeno, principal proteína estrutural achada no tecido conjuntivo animal, transformando-o em gelatina. As proteínas duras e elásticas que fazem as costeletas pouco cozidas impossíveis de mastigar e nada saborosas se transformam em gelatina com a água, o tempo e mais cozimento, fornecendo a textura macia que associamos com carnes ensopadas e costeletas adequadamente feitas. Junte um ingrediente ácido à marinada, porque ele ampliará a transformação do colágeno em gelatina, ou braseie para encorajar o processo. A chave para essa transformação é o fogo baixo. Contrastando com o fogo alto exigido para cozinhar cortes macios, o tempo e fogo constante são essenciais para transformar a carne escura e dura e o tecido conjuntivo numa gloriosa gelatina, quando seus grumos de gordura intramuscular derretem e regam a carne de dentro para fora.</p>
<p>&gt; Como o frango é muito mais denso que o ar quente do forno, a diferença de 15°C da temperatura da ave ao começar a assar — a diferença aproximada entre a temperatura da geladeira e a da cozinha — é substancialmente mais importante do que a mesma diferença na temperatura do forno. Você pode cozinhar um frango em temperatura ambiente a 200°C ou 215°C e notar pouca diferença no tempo de cozimento ou no resultado. Se assar uma ave fria, o tempo aumentará dramaticamente, e à primeira mordida você sentirá que a carne do peito está dura e seca. Deixe que todas as carnes — a não ser os cortes bem finos — cheguem à temperatura ambiente antes de cozinhá-las. Quanto maior a carne, mais cedo você deve tirá-la da geladeira. Um filé de costela deve ficar fora da geladeira por várias horas, enquanto um frango só precisa de um par delas, mas qualquer hora é melhor que nenhuma.</p>
<p>&gt; Deixe o fogo brando transformar o seco e duro em úmido e macio.</p>
<p>&gt; Como a fervura lenta é tão mais delicada do que rápida, não fica jogando a comida delicada de lá para cá até que se despedace, ou agitando tanto comidas duras que cozinham em excesso na superfície antes de cozinhar completamente por dentro.</p>
<p>&gt; Um ovo pochê pode fazer com que uma torrada, salada ou sopa se transforme numa refeição: no molho de tomate picante, viram shakshuka, prato popular do norte da África; com o molho marinara que sobrou da véspera e bastante parmesão ou pecorino, viram uova al purgatorio, a versão italiana de nome levemente sinistro.</p>
<p>&gt; Pense nesses pratos que levam tanto tempo para cozinhar como oportunidades para construir sabores. A cada passo, considere como dar mais sabor a um prato e extrair o gosto mais profundo de cada ingrediente. Aplique os princípios de assar e brasear para todos os pedaços duros de carne. Para preservar o sabor, deixe a carne em pedaços grandes e no osso quando possível. E lembre-se de salgar a carne antes, a fim de deixar que o sal cumpra sua tarefa de dentro para fora.</p>
<p>&gt; Monte seu assado de panela com os vegetais e ervas no fundo e depois a carne — tudo bem se os pedaços se tocarem nesse momento, o importante é que fiquem numa só camada, pois você já dourou —, então junte todo o líquido de deglaçar. Acrescente mais água ou caldo para chegar a um terço ou metade da altura da carne — mais do que isso você estará escalfando a carne, e não braseando.</p>
<p>&gt; ponha a panela apenas parcialmente sobre o queimador por um momento — enquanto um lado se acalma e cozinha, a fervura forçará toda a gordura e espuma a se juntar do outro lado, longe das bolhas. Escume a gordura com a colher ou uma escumadeira, devolva a panela ao centro do queimador e continue a ferver.</p>
<p>&gt; O vapor preso numa panela ou num caldeirão cozinha bem a comida, deixando-a clara e saborosa. No forno, isso já requer uma temperatura de pelo menos 230°C, enquanto a temperatura dentro do recipiente continuará a ser de 100°C, devido à reciclagem do vapor da água.</p>
<p>&gt; Mirepoix, a combinação aromática de cebola, cenoura e salsão é a raiz de toda a cozinha francesa.</p>
<p>&gt; Uma dica: mexer tende a dissipar o calor. Faça isso quando você estiver com medo de dourar e mexa menos se quiser que doure.</p>
<p>&gt; Resista a encher a panela ou mexer demais no começo. As proteínas especialmente grudam ao começarem a cozinhar. Deixe o peixe, o frango e a carne sossegados por alguns minutos — quando começarem a dourar, vão desgrudar da panela.</p>
<p>&gt; vapor, bolhas, ingredientes subindo ou dourados demais serão seus sinais. Quando a temperatura estiver quente o bastante, a comida chia e fica marrom — mas não depressa demais — ao ir para a panela. Quando as bolhas cessarem e o vapor diminuir, a crosta está boa. Quando a comida estiver dourada e crocante, pode ser retirada do óleo.</p>
<p>&gt; Como a temperatura ideal da fritura está além de 100°C, qualquer água no empanado ou na superfície da comida, a origem de todas aquelas bolhas, vai evaporar imediatamente. A chave para conseguir uma crosta crocante e dourada é forçar o vapor a escapar o mais depressa possível. Em outras palavras: não encha demais a panela.</p>
<p>&gt; Por mais que eu aquecesse minha panela de ferro fundido nele, nunca ficava quente o bastante para selar um bife sem cozinhá-lo demais. Depois de alguns bifes duros, comecei a preaquecer a panela no forno por 20 minutos pelo menos, antes de levá-la ao fogão para começar a selar. Funcionou.</p>
<p>&gt; Ao dourar, fritar ou selar, o primeiro lado de um alimento a ser dourado será sempre o mais bonito,</p>
<p>&gt; Use calor direto sobre as camadas de carvão mais quentes para as comidas menores e mais macias, como bifes finos, aves pequenas, como codornas, vegetais cortados, torradas finas, peitos de frango ou hambúrgueres. Use o calor mais dissipado, vindo de carvões próximos, a fim de criar pontos mais frios para grelhar carne com osso, cortes maiores e frangos inteiros. Zonas mais frias também são ideais para linguiça e carnes gordas, que ocasionam chamas, e para manter alimentos quentes.</p>
<p>&gt; Grelhando, gratinando ou assando, o importante é deixar todas as carnes macias descansarem depois de cozidas e antes de cortar, para que terminem de cozinhar sozinhas e as proteínas relaxem.</p>
<p>&gt; A superfície de qualquer comida que toque metal quente ficará marrom através da condução, o princípio da fritura no fogão.</p>
<p>&gt; Se está planejando assar carnes magras como peito de peru, organize-se antes, marinando ou passando algum tipo de gordura para garantir a umidade.</p>
<p>&gt; Comece a assar em forno quente (200°C-220°C) e gradualmente diminua a temperatura de 15°C em 15°C depois que começar a dourar, até que esteja pronta.</p>
<p>&gt; Carnes Pedaços de carne bem marmorizados e macios, como contrafilé ou lombo de porco, são ideais para assar, pois são suculentos o bastante para aguentar o calor seco do forno. Como já expliquei, ao cozinhar a carne solta gordura, o que a rega de dentro para fora.</p>
<p>&gt; Quando a gordura começar a derreter, reduza a temperatura a menos de 190°C, o ponto em que a maioria das gorduras animais começa a soltar fumaça.</p>

<p>Filmes de guerra estão em baixa? Não havia muitas pessoas na cabine de imprensa de Zona de Risco. Bom, não é dos gêneros mais populares. Talvez nunca tenha sido, se limitando quase sempre aos clássicos da luta interna de seus personagens, assim como boxe e outros esportes. Porém, se trata de um ótimo entretenimento para se ver na telona. E não é só pelas explosões, tiros e bombas. Há neste longa o desenvolvimento de uma ideia fina, quase sutil, sobre tecnologia na guerra e distrações do mundo moderno, que faz pensar por um breve momento; para um filme de ação já é muito.</p>
<p>A história começa da maneira mais clichê possível: uma tropa de elite das Forças Aéreas americana está em uma missão em território inimigo tomado por extremistas. O novato tenta começar um diálogo com os veteranos e no processo vários dos elementos da fórmula "filme de guerra" vão sendo destilados em frases nada brilhantes nem engraçadas. O objetivo é unicamente suscitar a empatia e entrosamento com aquelas pessoas que acabamos de conhecer, e como estão de farda transformá-los, nem que seja um pouco, em seres humanos "normais".</p>
<p>Se houvesse mais alguns astros de ação e armamento de nicho prontos para estourarem miolos poderíamos estar em mais um episódio de [Os Mercenários], mas o filme quer justamente mostrar o contraste entre o distanciamento do trabalho tecnológico do pessoal que fica no escritório soltando mísseis remotamente e o cara-a-cara com o perigo dos soldados em campo.</p>
<p>Bastam alguns minutos dessas pessoas conversando e fica claro que o filme está ciente que é mais um dos de guerra, o que é um truque sagaz, pois ele pisca inconscientemente para o espectador. O melhor momento é quando após um discurso sobre a barbárie que se esconde por trás de drones e ataques remotos em massa a barbárie começa a acontecer. Então o ator Ricky Whittle rouba a cena por três segundos, com sua sucinta e marcante frase: "que irônico, não?".</p>
<p>O pai de Whittle trabalhou nas Forças Aéreas inglesa e ele viveu a rotina de mudanças constantes, o que para mim dá um toque especial em sua fala e participação. Bem mais do que caras conhecidas de Hollywood, como os irmãos Liam e Luke Hemsworth, que representam a visão ideal do soldado branco americano em versões jovem e velho.</p>
<p>E por falar em velhos, Russell Crowe encabeça a lista como o amargurado e quase aposentado capitão Eddie Grimm "Reaper". Nenhum desses personagens realmente se merecem no filme e poderiam ser desenvolvido por atores mais baratos.</p>
<p>Ou talvez não, pois a visão que imagino que um espectador americano médio (e velho) é que se não há atores de elite trabalhando neles é porque não vale a pena ser visto, pois talvez não tenham cenas de ação "que paguem o ingresso". Por outro lado, quem vai mais ao cinema? Os velhos ou os jovens? Jovens não saem da telinha tanto quanto os velhos hoje em dia, o que acaba transformando o papel de Crowe em um herói por acidente. Ele é o único focado em seu trabalho de ajudar os meninos em campo.</p>
<p>Depois que as piscadelas ao espectador sobre "sim, este é mais um filme de guerra" a ação chacoalha o cinema, com uma tensão que se mantém pelo filme inteiro. Não há espaço para respirar. Quando há é para gerar um contraste inquieto, como as transições entre o Capitão Reaper fazendo compras no supermercado e os garotos em território inimigo precisando de alguém que os entenda além dos protocolos militares e limite de horas no trabalho (como se eles tivessem limite de horas para serem caçados pelos modernos vietcongues).</p>
<p>Pode ser claustrofóbico para espectadores dependendo da imersão de cada um na experiência de se sentir o menos desejado possível. Ou pior: o número de pessoas por metro quadrado desejando te matar e disposto a gastar quantas balas e bombas forem necessárias gera sentimentos mistos sobre a virtude de ser desejado (ou almejado). Talvez seja uma tara americana ser odiado por quase todo o mundo não-civilizado (e algumas partes ditas civilizadas também).</p>
<p>Parte da responsabilidade pela imersão tensa e orgânica na ação é da direção de William Eubank, que também é um diretor de fotografia experiente e designa ao filme uma experiência mista de filtros noturnos, ângulos tortos e planos fechados, que combinam perfeitamente com a sensação de nem conseguir seguir adiante nem se esconder para retomar as energias. Não que as cores do filme queiram dizer muita coisa, mas apenas não serem cores vivas em meio à ação já nos diz algo além.</p>
<p>Os heróis são esboços embalados pelos carismáticos atores, que encontram seus opostos nas figuras alienadas e impessoais do resto do batalhão assistindo uma partida de basquete pela TV do quartel. A exceção fica por conta do capitão Reaper e sua colega, que ensaiam o único traço de humanidade. Ela está para se casar e Reaper tem tudo planejado para ir à cerimônia. Ela possui um convite emocionante guardado para o final, mas não é sentido. Há tensão na tela para esquecermos as histórias dessas pessoas antes que elas voltem a conversar casualmente.</p>
<p>Enfim: ação e tensão em Zona de Risco se assistido no cinema, ou em um ambiente livre de distrações. Um desafio e tanto. Esta é a guerra dos cinéfilos civis em conseguir um lugar tranquilo para ver um bom filme.</p>

<p>Ingredientes: acelga, uma maçã,  pimenta vermelha coreana, cebola, cebolinha, alho, açúcar, sal.</p>
<p>Ingredientes opcionais: nabo, pimentão vermelho, gengibre ralado ou em pó, caldo de peixe (ou hondashi).</p>
<p>Para 900 gramas de acelga uma colher de sopa bem cheia de pimenta, uma cebola grande, meia colcha de caldo de peixe, cebolinha.</p>
<p>Sem lavar, cortar a acelga ao meio e retirar a ponta da base. Continuar cortando nesse sentido em fatias grossas, com cerca de dois a três dedos pelo menos de distância.</p>
<p>Adicionar um pouco de água nas fatias, cerca de uma xícara (depende do tamanho da acelga). Salgar bem por cima das fatias. Se houver muita acelga dividir em camadas e ir salgando cada uma delas, juntamente com um pouco de água, quase como uma salmora.</p>
<p>Deixar de duas a três horas descansando com um peso por cima (para murchar).</p>
<p>Após escorrer bastante líquido lavar a acelga de duas a três vezes para remover todo o excesso de sal e... para lavar a verdura. Deixe escorrer o excesso de água da lavagem por pelo menos meia-hora.</p>
<p>Se for usar nabo cortar em pedaços de grossura de três dedos e fatiar esses pedaços. Ele também precisa passar pelo processo de jogar sal para escorrer líquido (sem jogar água a mais). Isso é mais rápido, cerca de 10 a 20 minutos.</p>
<p>Se for usar caldo de peixe misture duas xícaras de água com um punhado de peixe seco (aqueles peixinhos com olhos esbugalhados que se acham no bairro da Liberdade). Deixar ferver por dois minutos, desligar o fogo e deixar esfriar. Se não tiver esses peixinhos um hondashi aquecido na água quente já basta.</p>
<p>Para fazer o tempero usa-se uma maçã inteira descascada sem semente, um pimentão vermelho e a pimenta vermelha coreana em pó. Para cada 900 gramas de acelga crua usar cerca de uma colher bem cheia como base. Colocar meia cebola grande. Adicionar o caldo de peixe (sem o peixe), uma colcha cheia para cada 900 gramas de acelga (sugestão). Por fim adicionar uma colher de chá de gengibre ralado ou em pó. Tudo isso vai batido no liquidificador.</p>
<p>Após bater colocar mais meia cebola grande que não será batida. É para aparecer junto do kimchi. Adicionar dois maços de cheiro verde (cebolinha) cortados com grossura de cerca de quatro dedos (bem grosseiro). Adicionar uma colher bem cheia de sopa de alho. Uma colher de sopa cheia de açúcar. Meia colher de sopa de sal ou um pouco a mais (a gosto). Misturar tudo com o recheio batido. Usar luvas para manusear (ou cobrir suas mãos com plástico), pois a pimenta coreana arde muito e vai machucar suas mãos. Repouse por uns quinze minutos para pegar bem os temperos.</p>
<p>Agora adicione este tempero na acelga já escorrida e limpinha. Misture com as mãos (de novo com luvas) para esfregar o tempero em todas as verdurinhas do kimchi (acelga e nabo e outros).</p>
<p>Para fermentar deixe dentro de um recipiente fechado em temperatura ambiente por 24 horas em ambiente quente e até 48 horas em ambientes mais amenos. Depois desse tempo irão surgir algumas bolhas e soltar um líquido em volta. Mantenha-o sempre mergulhado neste líquido, guarde na geladeira e curta eventualmente quando quiser acompanhar arroz e centenas de outros pratos. Se trata de um picles oriental que vai bem em tudo.</p>

<p>Li a primeira vez quando tinha 15 pra 16 anos. Hoje, muitas décadas depois, minha sensação sobre a atmosfera da história é muito próxima. Ela continua opressiva no sentido de ser uma leitura pesada, mas suas ideias são tão sólidas que vale a pena a revisita. Especialmente no meu caso, em que orbitei por muitos anos diferentes esferas ideológicas políticas e hoje revejo a epopeia de Winston Smith com um interesse maior em seu arco, em que quando adolescente a parte mais empolgante sempre será a dos "jovens" revoltados contra o sistema. Hoje para mim a análise do sistema em si é o mais fascinante, pois não soa nem um pouco fantástico. Há elementos da história que percorrem detalhes que vemos hoje em dia na política, de maneira diversa, claro, mas ainda assim próximo o suficiente para despertar terror ou pelo menos uma inquietação. E por isso vale a (re)leitura. Vou citar novamente um trecho que vi em algum lugar sobre Franz Kafka:</p>
<p>&gt; One day in 1904 the young Franz Kafka wrote a letter to a friend defining the books that are worth reading. “I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound us,” he wrote. “If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for?  So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.</p>
<p>&gt; Na filosofia, na religião, na ética ou na política, dois e dois podem ser cinco, mas, quando se está projetando uma arma ou um avião, dois e dois precisavam ser quatro.</p>
<p>&gt; Os objetivos desses três grupos são totalmente incompatíveis. O objetivo dos Altos é permanecer onde estão. O objetivo dos Médios é trocar de lugar com os Altos. O objetivo dos Baixos, quando eles o têm (pois é uma característica permanente dos Baixos que eles estejam oprimidos demais pelo trabalho para ter alguma consciência intermitente de qualquer coisa além de suas vidas diárias), é abolir todas as distinções e criar uma sociedade em que os homens sejam iguais.</p>
<p>&gt; A nova aristocracia era formada na maior parte por burocratas, cientistas, técnicos, líderes sindicais, peritos em publicidade, sociólogos, professores, jornalistas e políticos. Essas pessoas, cujas origens estavam na classe média assalariada e nos escalões superiores da classe trabalhadora, tinham sido formadas e reunidas pelo mundo árido do monopólio industrial e do governo centralizado.</p>
<p>&gt; Comparadas a seus equivalentes de tempos antigos, elas eram menos miseráveis, menos atraídas pelo luxo, mais sedentas pelo poder puro e, acima de tudo, mais conscientes do que estavam fazendo e deliberadamente esmagando a oposição.</p>
<p>&gt; Muito tempo antes, percebeu-se que a única base segura para a oligarquia é o coletivismo. A riqueza e o privilégio são mais facilmente defendidos quando possuídos de forma conjunta. A assim chamada “abolição da propriedade privada” que ocorreu em meados do século significou, na verdade, a concentração da propriedade em muito menos mãos do que antes; mas com esta diferença: os novos proprietários eram um grupo, em vez de uma massa de indivíduos.</p>
<p>&gt; Em princípio, o pertencimento a um desses três grupos não é hereditário. O filho de pais do Núcleo do Partido, em teoria, não nasce nele. A entrada em cada divisão do Partido se dá por meio de provas que se realizam aos dezesseis anos. Tampouco existe discriminação racial ou domínio acentuado de uma província ou outra. Judeus, negros e latino-americanos de puro sangue indígena podem ser encontrados nos mais altos escalões do Partido, e administradores de qualquer área são sempre escolhidos entre os habitantes daquela área.</p>
<p>&gt; O primeiro e mais simples estágio da disciplina, que pode ser ensinado até a crianças, é chamado, em Novidioma, de pararcrime. Pararcrime significa a capacidade de bloquear, como que por instinto, a fronteira de todo pensamento perigoso. Inclui o poder de não captar analogias, de falhar na percepção de erros de lógica, de entender mal os mais simples argumentos se eles forem adversários do Socing, e de se sentir entediado ou repelido por qualquer linha de raciocínio capaz de conduzir a uma direção herética. Pararcrime, em resumo, significa que a ignorância é uma bênção.</p>

<p class="note-title">2024-03-10 <a href="_202402.xhtml#_the_age_of_movies_selected_writings_of_pauline_kael">&lt;</a><a href="toc_books.xhtml">books</a><a href="_202403.xhtml#_a_historia_do_universo_para_quem_tem_pressa">&gt;</a></p>

<p>O livro "The Unwritten Laws of Engineering" da American Society of Mechanical Engineers (autoria de James G. Skakoon) se tornou um clássico recente por causa que as "leis" descobertas por este grupo de profissionais ao longo de suas carreiras se provaram não necessariamente corretas, mas úteis para a organização de engenheiros em torno não apenas em equipe, mas também por toda uma hierarquia corporativa que permite que mentes pensantes consigam trabalhar juntas em escalas cada vez maiores. Na era da engenharia da computação e suas dezenas de camadas de abstração a versão atualizada nas últimas décadas tem se provado atual. Algumas partes poderão ser revistas ao longo de mais uma geração, mas o núcleo que diz respeito em como tratar seu coleguinha deve se manter ainda por um bom tempo.</p>
<p>&gt; Bear in mind, therefore, that it may be worthwhile finishing a job, if it has any merit, just for the sake of finishing it.</p>
<p>&gt; An excellent guide in this respect may be found in the literary construction called the &quot;inverted pyramid.&quot; Start at the bottom — the beginning — with the single most important fact, the one the audience must know before learning more. Often this is the conclusion itself. Progressively broaden the pyramid by constructing each sentence to build upon its predecessor. In this way you will be able to clearly explain even complicated, abstract concepts to anyone.</p>
<p>&gt; Make it a practice to integrate, condense, summarize, and simplify your facts rather than expand, ramify, complicate, and disintegrate them.</p>
<p>&gt; Engineering meetings should neither be too large nor too small.</p>
<p>&gt; As Ralph Waldo Emerson puts it: &quot;What you are . . . thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; To be safe, you had better assume that your documents might go to anyone and that they will exist forever.</p>

<h1 class="chapter-subtitle"><strong>Treinamento do Datilógrafo (The Typewriter Training)</strong></h1>
<p class="note-title">2024-03-30 <a href="_202403.xhtml#_a_perfeicao_moral_marco_aurelio">&lt;</a><a href="toc_self.xhtml">self</a><a href="_202404.xhtml#_the_hackers_diet_john_walker">&gt;</a></p>

<p>Há fóruns e mais fóruns na internet cheio de escritores querendo saber como fazer para começar a escrever. Uma das técnicas mais eficazes é simplesmente sair escrevendo sem parar. Isso serve para bloqueios e reescritas inconscientes que fazemos ao tentar reformular uma frase assim que ela foi criada. Torna o ato de escrever mais próximo do pensamento em si: um fluxo ininterrupto de cognição interna. Erros não devem ser corrigidos. Nem acentos. Usar o backspace é proibido. Assim como nos velhos tempos da datilografia.</p>
<p>Escrever por impulso se torna uma técnica que treina a mente e os músculos dos dedos, para que ambos não fiquem tensos e você desista rapidamente ou associe com algo desagradável. Escrever deve ser tão agradável e viciante quanto navegar nas redes sociais, para que no final do dia, quando bater aquela vontade de vadiar, o escritor diletante vá direto para seu rascunho digitar sem parar.</p>
<p>Chamo isto de treinamento de datilografia porque foi exatamente assim que aprendi a usar o teclado mecânico de uma máquina de escrever, através de um livro de exercícios. Um livro de treinamento irá dizer ao datilógrafo que ele não deve corrigir uma linha recém-digitada, mas partir para a próxima linha até fazer certo da primeira vez. Com o tempo isso será automático. Nesse caso é o treinamento dos músculos.</p>
<h2>Reescrita não é revisão</h2>
<p>Após essa tempestade de escrita haverá um texto muito maior que o necessário e com muito mais tempo de reescrita. Não iremos chamar de revisão, pois a ideia central desse treinamento é que você utilize o texto gerado como um guia, mas nunca como algo próximo de uma versão final. Há muito ainda que aparar e o "rascunho final" deve ser uma versão mais alinhada com o processo de escrita em si, mais formal e crítico que o pensamento solto, do que o resultado desse exercício free style. Chamar de reescrita também nos sugere a ideia de que é possível refazer tudo do zero. São as ideias que importam, não a forma. Cortar texto deve ser uma coisa normal. Estar totalmente focado na escrita e não na correção deve ser algo normal.</p>
<p>Essa mudança de postura compete com o vadiar. Haverá, sim, a vontade de vadiar, como sempre há, mas essa vontade irá competir com a vontade de escrever besteira que se tornará texto. Isso deve acontecer não porque o escritor está se forçando a escrever, mas porque o esforço mental da escrita deve ser o mesmo ou equivalente a vadiar, com a diferença que a recompensa de escrever acaba sendo bem melhor.</p>

<p>Na última viagem à Argentina fiquei interessado em variar de casta e portanto abandonei o Malbec por um tempo. Pedi nas casas de vinhos alguns exemplares de Bonarda para entender melhor a fruta.</p>
<p>O primeiro que abri foi este da Paso a Paso, 2019, da linha Vinos de Garage. São microlotes pensados aos poucos por enólogos que desejam produzir vinhos com o mínimo de intervenção, como a adição do carvalho. O Bonarda desse vinho é bem azedo, mas ao decorrer dos dias ele foi ficando mais azedo ainda, apesar de menos alcoólico. Ele é gostoso para beber sozinho. Ele lembra o azedo do Burbujas de Altura, de Cafayate, mas que azedou, que acho que estava estragado, mas tudo bem. Nesse da Paso a Paso há um frescor além do azedo, e tons muito vibrantes.</p>
<p>A segunda garrafa foi este Las Tortugas Estate, de 2020, da Nieto Senetiner, mais conhecida no Brasil por vinhos industriais. Este Bonarda é completamente diferente do anterior. Não é azedo e seu aroma é enebriante, muito mais que o sabor, que lembra coisas que são mais cheiradas que bebidas, como charuto, mas também embutidos. Há um equilíbrio de acidez perene na boca e uma personalidade forte. Não é para amadores. Aroma e paladar são distintos. Ficou 12 meses em carvalho francês e 6 meses em guarda na garrafa. A safra deste ano foi atípica por causa dos fatores climáticos e hídricos com a antecipação da colheita em 10 a até quase um mês (4 de abril). Da região de Agrelo da Finda Las Tortugas (daí o nome). O fechamento em cera da rolha me fez cortar o dedo.</p>

<p>O café da Dividendo Café, que achamos no dia do aniversário da Mitiko em Mauá, está um pouco mais azedo essa semana. Ele não era tanto semana passada. Agora veio uma doçura bem agradável. Foram dias interessantes passando este café. O bom do lugar é que é uma microtorrefação e o dono faz as torras. Os dois espressos provados por lá estavam sensacionais. Para mim este é o novo crème de la crème dos cafés especiais: ir em uma microtorrefação em que as torras são pequenas e precisas, de acordo com a personalidade do mestre torrador. Os cafezes que conheci de marca ou dos mais popularzinhos como Coffee Lab ou Por Um Punhado de Dólares não chegam próximo do cuidado desses lugares menores. Café é um assunto que exige detalhes além da capacidade de um simples negócio. Não adianta jogar um monte de funcionários para trabalhar uma torra, por melhor que ela seja. Talvez apenas com bons e dedicados baristas, o que é difícil de achar se você precisa escalar os negócios. Coffee Lab é gigante se comparado a uma microtorrefação e Por Um Punhado é uma franquia. Eu vi os barris de café disponíveis na cafeteria do centro, mas o espresso que provei de lá não chegava próximo de um especial, mas de um comunzinho de rede. Possui as notas de azedo que tanto as pessoas gostam hoje em dia, mas insosso no corpo e um amargor desagradável. Achei o mesmo quando fui no Coffe Lab apenas pelo espresso. Da série de bons lugares porque têm bons baristas vem um café próximo da estação Fradique Coutinho, o Coffee Walk. Bom pão de queijo e café bem sincero. Revisitaria.</p>

<p>Uma das coisas mais irritantes no WinDbg é quando ele trava sem motivo aparente. Isso pode acontecer porque ele está baixando símbolos de módulos necessários para mostrar o resultado do comando enviado ou procurando por eles. O comando !sym noisy ajuda a manter alguma saída na tela para entender esse cenário. Entre esses cenários o mais irritante é quando colocamos um breakpoint em um ponto no código fonte e ele precisa encontrar qual o módulo correspondente se ele ainda não souber. Para fazer isso ele sai baixando os símbolos de todos os módulos até encontrar. E ele não para facilmente nesse caso, então os comandos de break não irão funcionar. A janela do WinDbg parecerá travada e não há nada o que fazer.</p>
<p>Para evitar isso coloque um breakpoint deferido para uma função conhecida do código fonte onde quer colocar o breakpoint original. Tendo um nome o WinDbg saberá pelo escopo do módulo que quando este módulo for carregado na memória ele precisa baixar os símbolos deste módulo e setar este breakpoint. Quando isso acontecer e o breakpoint for ativado você pode colocar o breakpoint específico pela janela do código fonte e isso ocorrerá de maneira instantânea, pois agora o debugger já sabe do que você está falando.</p>
<p>Isso pode economizar de alguns minutos a mais de uma hora de espera.</p>

<p>Quando precisar comparar duas execuções distintas pelos logs do procmon primeiro você precisa eliminar as colunas que serão obviamente diferentes, como data e hora e talvez detalhes da operação. Mantenha o PID, pois com o PID é possível identificar o processo no meio de vários que precisar logar.</p>
<p>No entanto, como comparar execuções distintas com PIDs distintos? É preciso modificar o CSV exportado desses eventos.</p>
<p>Imagine que você tem um arquivo nesse formato:</p>
<pre>
&quot;PID&quot;,&quot;Operation&quot;,&quot;Path&quot;,&quot;Result&quot;
&quot;1332&quot;,&quot;Process Start&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;SUCCESS&quot;
&quot;1332&quot;,&quot;Thread Create&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;SUCCESS&quot;
&quot;1332&quot;,&quot;Load Image&quot;,&quot;C:\Treasury Navigator Secure Browser\mscbssb.exe&quot;,&quot;SUCCESS&quot;
...
&quot;14456&quot;,&quot;Load Image&quot;,&quot;C:\Treasury Navigator Secure Browser\mscbssb.exe&quot;,&quot;SUCCESS&quot;
&quot;14456&quot;,&quot;Load Image&quot;,&quot;C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll&quot;,&quot;SUCCESS&quot;
...
</pre>
<p>Elimine o header do início e rode o seguinte programa awk para seu arquivo:</p>
<pre>
gawk 'BEGIN { FS=&quot;,&quot;; PID=1 } { if( !($1 in PIDS) ) PIDS[$1]=PID++ ; $1 = PIDS[$1] ; print $0 }' Logfile.CSV &gt; Logfile_PSEUDOPIDS.CSV
</pre>
<p>O programa acima troca o separador de campos por vírgula e inicia uma variável PID como 1. Depois a cada passada de linha ele popula um mapa de PIDs reais por pseudo-PIDs e troca o campo do PID real pelo valor do pseudo-PID. Ao final você terá um arquivo com pseudo-PIDs 1, 2, 3, etc, em vez dos PIDs reais. Com isso é possível comparar mais de uma execução com os "mesmos" PIDs, ou ao menos PIDs que vão mudando de maneira ordenada.</p>

<p>Não me lembrava de alguns detalhes deste livro curto e eficaz, assim como a vida dos cidadãos desta fantasia utópica onde o prazer é sinônimo de felicidade e significado para todos desta sociedade de castas e planejada desde o nascimento até a morte de seus indivíduos. Eu me lembrava que seria muito bom viver em um lugar onde você deve copular com o maior número de fêmeas que conseguir, mas na idade que havia lido perdi a ironia fina de que apenas os alfas possuem este privilégio, já que entre as dezenas de clones de gamas você vai copular com muitas fêmeas, sim, mas todas têm a mesma cara.</p>
<p>O choque de culturas é o que apimenta esta história de Aldous Huxley, quando após as apresentações de como este mundo funciona um selvagem das antigas adentra o recinto. Munido de frases de Shakespeare, a única leitura que teve acesso em toda sua vida, ele é o extremo que serve de lupa para o desconforto dos herois da história.</p>
<p>Bernardo Marx é um alfa que dizem que deu errado. Mais baixo que seus iguais e com hábitos que vão contra a moral poligâmica, ele é nossa identidade de cidadão comum que se deu mal apesar de estar em uma posição muito boa. Quase um anti heroi. Seu amigo deseja escrever sobre algo que valha a pena ser escrito, mas a vida sem desafios é um ambiente estéril para a jornada do heroi que estamos acostumados a ler e assistir.</p>
<p>Brave New World se trata do irmão gêmeo de 1984, utopia mais pessimista de George Orwell e escrita na década seguinte (de 1948, Brave New World é de 32). Estes dois livros deviam ser lidos juntos, pois se trata das visões extremas e perfeitas do que o autoritarismo é capaz de fazer com a coletividade. Ambos infelizmente são atuais e, podemos dizer, sempre serão.</p>
<p>&gt; Mas eu quero – insistiu ele. – Isso me dá a sensação... – hesitou, procurando as palavras – ... a sensação de ser mais eu, se é que você compreende o que quero dizer. De agir mais por mim mesmo, e não tão completamente como parte de alguma outra coisa.</p>

<p>&gt; Mas ele tem razão – disse Helmholtz com ar sombrio. – É realmente idiota. Escrever quando nada há a dizer... – Justamente. E isso exige a maior habilidade. Os senhores fabricam calhambeques com o mínimo absoluto de aço, obras de arte com praticamente nada mais que sensação pura.</p>
<p>&gt; Não é somente a arte que é incompatível com a felicidade, também o é a ciência. Ela é perigosa; temos de mantê-la cuidadosamente acorrentada e amordaçada. – O quê? – exclamou Helmholtz, assombrado. – Mas nós vivemos repetindo que a ciência é tudo. É um lugar-comum hipnopédico. – Três vezes por semana, dos treze aos dezoito anos – recitou Bernard. – E toda a propaganda da ciência que fazemos no Colégio... – Sim, mas que espécie de ciência? – perguntou sarcasticamente Mustafá Mond. – Os senhores não receberam instrução científica, de modo que não têm condições de julgar.</p>

<p>Achei em um Extra um pacote de 250g por 20 reais, o que nos termos atuais se traduz como barato. E está em grãos. É de qualidade sem ser uma torra muito escura. Não há nada demais nele, mas nenhum defeito grave também. É da Fazenda Sertãozinho, em Botelhos, do lado de Poços de Caldas. Lá repousa um Jequitibá Rosa de 1500 anos e muita história. Era uma fazenda de exportação de café e aos poucos se reformulou para o consumo interno. Dividiram-se as safras para atingir uma qualidade melhor. É deles a marca Orfeu, logo ao lado na mesma prateleira (e que também é relativamente fácil de encontrar em grãos em mercados).</p>

<h1 class="chapter-subtitle"><strong>A Revolução dos Bichos - George Orwell (George Orwell)</strong></h1>
<p class="note-title">2024-03-30 <a href="_202403.xhtml#_admiravel_mundo_novo">&lt;</a><a href="toc_books.xhtml">books</a><a href="_202403.xhtml#_sal_gordura_acido_calor_salt_fat_acid_heat_nosrat_samin">&gt;</a></p>

<p>Este é um livro facinho e rápido de ler que lhe dará um breve e didático resumo sobre a revolução russa. Crianças podem ler. Jovens podem ler. Dificilmente alguém não irá entender.</p>
<p>A não ser que você seja um "intelectual" de esquerda especializado em marxismo. Te falta ódio e sobra inveja, amiguinho.</p>
<p>&gt; Naquela tarde, Garganta explicou aos outros bichos, em particular, que Napoleão nunca fora contra a construção do moinho de vento. Pelo contrário, ele é que advogara a ideia desde o início, e o projeto que Bola-de-Neve havia desenhado no assoalho do galpão das incubadoras fora, na realidade, roubado de entre os papéis de Napoleão. O moinho de vento era, na verdade, criação do próprio Napoleão. Por que, então, perguntou alguém, ele falou tanto contra o moinho? Garganta olhou, manhoso. Aí é que estava a esperteza do Camarada Napoleão, disse. Ele fingira ser contra o moinho de vento, apenas como manobra para livrar-se de Bola-de-Neve, que era um péssimo caráter e uma influência perniciosa.</p>
<p>&gt; Se ela própria pudesse imaginar o futuro, veria uma sociedade de animais livres da fome e do chicote, todos iguais, cada qual trabalhando de acordo com sua capacidade, os mais fortes protegendo os mais fracos, como ela protegera aquela ninhada de patinhos na noite do discurso do Major. Em vez disso — não podia compreender por quê — havia chegado uma época em que ninguém ousava dizer o que pensava, em que cachorros rosnadores e malignos perambulavam por toda parte e todos eram obrigados a ver camaradas feitos em pedaços após confessar os crimes mais chocantes.</p>
<p>&gt; De certa maneira, era como se a granja tivesse ficado rica sem que nenhum animal houvesse enriquecido — exceto, é claro, os porcos e os cachorros. Talvez isso acontecesse por existirem ali tantos porcos e tantos cachorros. Não que esses animais não trabalhassem, à sua moda.</p>
<h2>Posfácio Repensando A Revolução dos Bichos | Christopher Hitchens (2006)</h2>
<p>&gt; &quot;Pensei em denunciar o mito soviético numa história que fosse fácil de compreender por qualquer pessoa e fácil de traduzir para outras línguas.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; Em seguida morre, mas a mensagem arrebatadora dessa figura inspirada em Marx logo é adotada pelos porcos mais cultos, a intelligentsia do mundo animal. Conseguem forjar uma aliança entre os fortes cavalos Sansão e Quitéria, que representam o proletariado, e os elementos disparatados do campo e da classe média representados pelas ovelhas, pelas vacas, pelas galinhas e outras forças dos pastos e do quintal.</p>
<p>&gt; Mas é o cuidado com os detalhes que impressiona: Moisés, o corvo, acaba obtendo permissão de voltar à fazenda, assim como Stálin permitiu a reentrada em atividade da Igreja ortodoxa russa durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, e a “Internacional Socialista” foi substituída por versos e palavras de ordem mais simples.</p>
<p>&gt; Por isso, é mais estranho ainda que, em determinado aspecto, a analogia seja extremamente enganosa e incompleta. É muito óbvio, e não só devido ao nome, que Napoleão deve representar Stálin. E é igualmente óbvio, inclusive no que diz respeito a seu exílio e sua queda em desgraça, que o outro líder dos porcos, Bola-de-Neve, pretende representar Trotski. Mas onde fica Lênin nisso tudo?</p>
<p>&gt; Os trotskistas denunciavam Stálin como o “coveiro” do leninismo; os stalinistas reivindicavam o manto de Lênin. Só as forças conservadoras diziam que o leninismo e o stalinismo não passavam de dois nomes para a mesma coisa. E toda a “moral” da história se perde se a ideia da revolução dos bichos for perversa ou irracional desde o início. Assim, conscientemente ou não, Orwell apaga a figura que teria deixado sua história um pouco complicada demais</p>
<p>&gt; (Estranhamente, ou talvez por motivos semelhantes, também existe um Stálin, na forma do Grande Irmão, e um Trotski, na forma de Emmanuel Goldstein, em 1984. Mas Lênin está ausente.)</p>
<p>&gt; A parte dos nossos emigrantes que foi parar no exílio não só devido a convicções nacionalistas, mas pelo que sentiam vagamente tratar-se de uma procura da “dignidade humana” e da “liberdade”, não se sente nem um pouco reconfortada quando algum intelectual de direita lhe faz uma advertência eloquente. Estava especialmente ansiosa para ouvir alguma coisa desse tipo, mas produzida no campo socialista, do qual se sentia intelectualmente mais próxima […] Em várias ocasiões traduzi diferentes trechos de A revolução dos bichos. Meus ouvintes eram refugiados soviéticos. O efeito sempre foi impressionante. Concordavam com quase todas as suas interpretações. Sentiam-se profundamente afetados por cenas como as dos animais cantando “Bichos da Inglaterra” no alto da encosta.</p>
<p>&gt; O livro é famoso por terminar com os animais reunidos do lado de fora, no frio, observando o rapprochement entre porcos e seres humanos e incapazes de distinguir quem era o quê. Isso já foi entendido, erradamente, como a afirmação da equivalência moral entre capitalismo e comunismo, e por essa razão o trecho foi cortado do desenho produzido pela CIA.</p>
<p>&gt; Na verdade, como sabemos pelo próprio Orwell, o final era uma referência sarcástica ao então famoso encontro de Teerã reunindo Churchill, Roosevelt e Stálin. Saudado num primeiro momento como uma promessa de cooperação no pós-guerra entre os diversos blocos, o encontro lhe pareceu uma reunião cínica destinada à partilha do butim, cujos efeitos dificilmente haveriam de durar muito. (O acordo subsequente firmado em Yalta, consolidando a divisão da Europa e do resto do mundo, inaugurou o estado de permanente “Guerra Fria” — expressão cunhada por Orwell — que caracterizaria 1984.)</p>
<h2>A liberdade de imprensa (prefácio proposto pelo autor à primeira edição inglesa, de 1945)</h2>
<p>&gt; Se a fábula tratasse de ditadores e ditaduras em geral, não haveria problema em publicá-la, mas ela, como agora entendi, corresponde tão completamente aos fatos ocorridos na Rússia soviética e a seus dois ditadores que só pode se aplicar à Rússia, excluindo as demais ditaduras. Outra coisa: seria menos ofensivo se a casta predominante na fábula não fosse a dos porcos.** Creio que a escolha dos porcos para a casta governante irá certamente ofender muita gente, especialmente as pessoas mais suscetíveis, como sem dúvida é o caso dos russos.</p>
<p>&gt; No momento atual, o que a ortodoxia predominante exige é uma admiração acrítica da Rússia soviética. Todo mundo sabe disso, e quase todo mundo age de acordo. Qualquer crítica séria ao regime dos sovietes, qualquer revelação de fatos que o governo soviético prefira manter ocultos são coisas praticamente impublicáveis. E essa conspiração de alcance nacional destinada a agradar nossa aliada ocorre, o que é muito curioso, contra um fundo de autêntica tolerância intelectual</p>
<p>&gt; A questão em jogo aqui é muito simples: será que qualquer opinião, por mais impopular — por mais estúpida, até — que seja, tem o direito de ser difundida? Formule-se a questão dessa maneira, e qualquer intelectual inglês se sentirá obrigado a responder que sim. Mas quando ela se reveste de uma forma concreta, e alguém pergunta: “E que tal, por exemplo, um ataque a Stálin? Tem direito de ser difundido?”, a resposta quase sempre será não. Neste caso, o que ocorre é um desafio à ortodoxia corrente, de maneira que o princípio da liberdade de expressão deixa de funcionar. Quando alguém defende a liberdade de expressão e de imprensa, não está reivindicando uma liberdade absoluta. Enquanto existirem sociedades organizadas, sempre deve existir, ou pelo menos sempre haverá de existir, algum grau de censura.</p>
<p>&gt; Quem começa a desprezar a liberdade, tanto na teoria quanto na prática, é só, ou principalmente, a intelligentsia literária e científica, exatamente aqueles que deveriam ser seus maiores guardiães.</p>
<p>&gt; Essas pessoas não veem que, quando se endossam métodos totalitários, pode chegar um momento em que deixarão de ser usados a favor para se voltarem contra o indivíduo. Caso se transforme num hábito jogar fascistas na prisão sem julgamento, o processo talvez não se limite aos fascistas.</p>
<h2>Prefácio do autor à edição ucraniana (1947)</h2>
<p>&gt; Tornei-me pró-socialista mais por desgosto com a maneira como os setores mais pobres dos trabalhadores industriais eram oprimidos e negligenciados do que devido a qualquer admiração teórica por uma sociedade planificada.</p>
<p>&gt; Essas caçadas humanas ocorriam na Espanha ao mesmo tempo que os grandes expurgos na URSS, e eram uma espécie de complemento a eles. Tanto na Espanha como na Rússia, a natureza das acusações (a saber, conspiração com os fascistas) era a mesma, e no que diz respeito à Espanha, tenho todos os motivos para julgar que fossem falsas. Vivenciar tudo isso foi uma lição valiosa: ensinou-me como é fácil para a propaganda totalitária controlar a opinião de pessoas educadas em países democráticos.</p>

<p>Com muito tato e poucos diálogos, este filme é um coming of age discreto para os padrões da época, mas profundo em suas questões existenciais. A vida em sociedade (moderna e tradicional) pode ser tolerada, mas quando temos a opção de viver apenas com as pessoas que amamos é loucura pedir por mais.</p>
<p>Brooke Shields e um belo rapaz vivem um conto de fadas isolados no paraíso e munidos dos conhecimentos de sobrevivência e sem muitos dos vícios desnecessários. É uma vida plena, ingênua enquanto pura ou vice-versa, pautada no agora e na ação.</p>
<p>As funções do homem e da mulher nesta sociedade de dois não estão deturpados. Pelo contrário: são intuídos pelos dois. Sua moral provém de seus mecanismos biológicos, e a única lei que deveriam seguir se comprova acertada no longo prazo.</p>
<p>Uma viagem ao passado nostálgico das reprises do SBT. Bom, eu não me lembrava de muita coisa. Acho que nunca assisti esse filme por inteiro como agora. Era coisa de menina. Hoje, é um passado irretocável que gera a nostalgia dos filmes puros que não querem te forçar a ignorar a realidade.</p>

<p>Wes Anderson dirige mais esta fábula adaptada de uma peça inacabada sobre uma cidade no meio do deserto e a narrativa em si. Além de vários atores de alto escalão, inclusive um Tom Hanks velho e uma Scarlett Johansson pagando peitinho, tem alien e ele é fofinho, veio buscar a bola que deixou cair.</p>

<p>Um bom café em uma rua tranquila. O espresso é bem saboroso. A prensa francesa para dois já é servida nas canecas. Eles têm vários métodos e cafés disponíveis. É mais espaçoso quando não chove, pois há um espaço anexo sem coberto. O pão é gostoso, bem fermentado. Um bom lugar para passar a tarde. Voltaria.</p>

<p>Priscila é o busão que leva três coroas que gostam de se vestir de mulher para um road movie dos anos 90, quando “cavalheiros estavam em extinção e transexuais estavam se reproduzindo como coelhos”. Profético e espirituoso, sua alma são esses três atores maravilhosos em uma escalação pra lá de inspirada. Terence Stamp havia feito uma década atrás General Zod, arqui-inimigo de Superman. Sua cara fechada conclui várias tiradas do filme e gera mais profundidade ao suposto drama. Hugo Weaving (Matrix, Senhor dos Aneis) empresta seus tons ardilosos e sua voz mais serena para um ser que está sempre se julgando quando o mundo não parece se importar. Seu oposto é o personagem de Guy Pearce (Amnésia), expansivo e correndo o risco de ser uma bicha genérica. As locações no deserto australiano e o figurino brega fantástico dão o charme final a um trabalho parcialmente musical, dramático e cômico. Nenhum dos três gêneros possui a energia que merece. O final é uma sessão da tarde que impõe o apelo comercial para um projeto precursor, que precisa apresentar a mitologia trans para os não iniciados. Na época quase toda a humanidade.</p>

<p>&gt; &quot;Os homens procuram refúgio no campo, no litoral, nas montanhas; e você também tem anseios frequentes por tais distrações. No entanto, certamente isso é uma grande tolice, já que você pode se retirar para dentro de si mesmo a qualquer hora que quiser. Em nenhum lugar um homem pode encontrar um refúgio mais tranquilo e mais cheio de lazer do que em sua própria alma, especialmente quando há algo dentro dele sobre o qual, se ele apenas olhar, estará imediatamente em repouso. E o resto eu considero nada mais que perfeita ordem na alma. Portanto, permita-se este retiro constante, e, assim, renove-se.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Knowing is not enough, you must apply; willing is not enough, you must do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Bruce Lee</blockquote>

<h2>Ação</h2>

<p>Antes de tudo é necessário executar exercícios leves para começar o dia e aquecer todos os principais músculos.</p>

<blockquote>In order to become stronger, your body needs three things: Stress, Recovery and Adaptation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The 8 bodyweight exercises that focus on the basic human movement patterns in the best possible way are the following: 1. Pull-ups 2. Push-ups 3. Weighted lunges 4. Dips 5. Inverted Rows 6. Handstand Push-ups 7. Leg Raises 8. Prone Cobra</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you would tell me you only have time for three exercises, I would tell you to pick Handstand push-ups, Pull-ups and Weighted lunges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can define what calisthenics is for you and your life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have plenty of opportunities to practice every day, and, over a short period of time, you can develop a keen sense of what your body really needs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The real source of knowledge and understanding is to take massive action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can usually identify tendon pain in the form of a sharp and burning sensation around a joint, especially when the joint is under a load. Tendon pain often occurs in joints that have little muscular support like the knees, elbows, and wrists. Pain in these areas should always be addressed and never “worked through” or ignored. Doing so only leads to a greater degree of internal damage, often requiring more serious measures to address it in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Focusing on the negative rather than the positive phase is also another important factor in bodyweight exercise. You don't have to overdo it as some people believe; however you need to be actively controlling the movement while you are lowering your weight instead of letting gravity doing the work for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Low rep ranges improve muscle recruitment, which is defined as the number of motor units (motor neurons integrated to muscle fibers) activated in the muscle and generating force during contraction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>High rep ranges (8-15 reps) cause our muscles to store additional glycogen. Glycogen is, in simple words, liquid muscle sugar. It is the main fuel used by the muscles in high rep ranges and it contributes to the increase in our muscle's size.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Legs, in comparison with other muscle groups, have been shown to require higher intensity and training volume in order to get stronger and grow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Kinesthetic awareness is your body’s awareness of your surroundings, which you receive via the sensory receptors in your joints, muscles & skin.</blockquote>
<h2>Restauração</h2>

<blockquote>When you finish your workout without winding down, your nervous system remains in sympathetic dominance, which promotes your body’s fight-or-flight instincts—a stressful state in which to spend the rest of your day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Getting proper sleep should always be as high a priority as sticking to your diet and exercise habits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Recovery also includes mental and emotional rest. Meditation, relaxing, and just plain having fun are not luxuries. They are essential elements in your health and should be pursued on a daily basis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>While it is possible to skip your cool down exercises, practicing them ensures that you remain in control, so you’re less likely to crash later on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Proper hormonal secretion depends highly on having a proper sleep cycle.</blockquote>
<h2>Nutrição</h2>

<blockquote>Stoplight strategy to your needs and preferences.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Whole foods are the opposite of refined foods; they fill you up, give you energy, and make it much harder to consume more calories than your body can handle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On a fundamental level, your body uses your fat when you don’t consume enough to support your current bodyweight. This is why you want to make sure you’re not eating too much, even if your diet is squeaky clean.</blockquote>
<h2>Reflexão</h2>

<blockquote>Balance your body and you will find balance in life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Strengthen your muscles and your mind will follow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Exercise and physical training are meant to make you feel good and improve your quality of life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The most important thing to remember is that your healthy habits should improve how you feel. They should make you feel happier, more motivated, more energized, and should reduce pain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In fitness, stress is like medicine. In the right doses, stress stimulates health and progress. However, if you get the dose wrong, stress can poison both body and mind and break your results rather than make them.</blockquote>

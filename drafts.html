<p>Estou fazendo um experimento. Tão interessado que estou em entender o self para aprimorá-lo com leituras e releituras de várias fontes distintas que me veio à mente: é este o primeiro tema que devo desenvolver profundamente.</p>
<p>Irei, portanto, rever minhas leituras em paralelo, talvez alguma coisa a mais, e tentarei aumentar a profundidade de um dos meus rascuhos, que ficará por aqui o tempo suficiente até eu ter delineado qual seria um bom roteiro para um texto para este assunto.</p>
<h3>Recortes</h3>
<p>“Não posso mais viver comigo”, pensei. Então, de repente, tomei consciência de como aquele pensamento era peculiar. “Eu sou um ou sou dois? Se eu não consigo mais viver comigo, deve haver dois de mim: o ‘eu’ e o ‘eu interior’, com quem o ‘eu’ não consegue mais conviver.” “Talvez”, pensei, “só um dos dois seja real.” <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>Embora eu continuasse vivendo normalmente, tinha percebido que nada que eu viesse a fazer poderia mudar realmente a minha vida. Eu já tinha tudo de que necessitava. <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>Tempos depois, as pessoas iriam se aproximar de mim e dizer: “Quero o que você tem. Você pode me dar ou me mostrar como conseguir?” Eu respondia: “Você já tem. Mas não consegue sentir porque a sua mente está fazendo muito barulho.” <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>All that we are is the result of all that we have thought. It is founded on thought. It is based on thought. — Buddha, The Dhammapada <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The Thinker can think about virtually anything. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on one law only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>Of course, it is fairly easy to see that other people’s minds operate this way; it is comparatively much harder to become aware that one’s own mind is working that way also. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The reader will absolutely not understand this book unless he or she does the exercizes given at the end of each chapter. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>Mas a verdade é que uma das características de nossa época, uma das fontes ou causas das angústias, conflitos e aflições do nosso tempo parece que está na complexidade, na diversidade e na infidedignidade da comunicação oral ou escrita, quer entre indivíduos quer entre grupos. Sabemos dos mal-entendidos, dos preconceitos, das prevenções, das incompreensões e dos atritos resultantes da incúria da expressão, dos seus sofismas e paralogismos. São as generalizações apressadas, as declarações gratuitas, as indiscriminações, os clichês, os rótulos, os falsos axiomas, a polissemia, a polarização, os falsos juízos, as opiniões discriminatórias, as afirmações puras e simples, carentes de prova... Enfim, linguagem falaciosa, por malícia, quando não por incúria da atividade mental, ou por ignorância dos mais comezinhos princípios da lógica. Esses óbices ou barreiras verbais e mentais impedem ou desfiguram totalmente a comunicação, o entendimento entre os homens e os povos, sendo não raro causa de atritos e conflitos. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>You started with something difficult and made it easy and pleasurable through instruction and practice. You took a master's journey. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>For most people brought up in this society, the plateau can be a form of purgatory. It triggers dis- owned emotions. It flushes out hidden motivations. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The evidence is clear: all of us who are born with- out serious genetic defects are born geniuses. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>But genius, no matter how bright, will come to naught or swiftly burn out if you don't choose the master's journey. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Learning any new skill involves relatively brief spurts of progress, each of which is followed by a slight decline to a plateau somewhat higher in most cases than that which pre- ceded it. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The cognitive and effort systems become subsets of the habitual system long enough to modify it, to teach it a new behavior. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>This brings into play what might be called a cog- nitive system, associated with the habitual system, and an effort system, associated with the hippocam- pus (situated at the base of the brain). <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>In this light, you can see that those upward surges on the mastery curve are by no means the only time anything significant or exciting is happening. Learn- ing generally occurs in stages. A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have with- drawn. This means you can perform the task without making a special effort to think of its separate parts. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>How do you best move toward mastery? To put it simply, you practice diligently, but you practice pri- marily for the sake of the practice itself. Rather than being frustrated while on the plateau, you learn to appreciate and enjoy it just as much as you do the upward surges. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>In the forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed forty-four films that received twenty-three Academy Award nominations—an absurd rate of artistic productivity. Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing all his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3 manual typewriter. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected isolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These subsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John Freeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The Distraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Given this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this book trying to establish this point. We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today. There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning. We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>So how can we reach this elusive goal that cannot be attained by a direct route? My studies of the past quarter-century have convinced me that there is a way. It is a circuitous path that begins with achieving control over the contents of our consciousness. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.” <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature. At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. The Romans reached that juncture after several centuries of ruling the Mediterranean, the Chinese were confident of their immutable superiority before the Mongol conquest, and the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening. When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It might well be, in fact, that much of the world's depression and discontent, and perhaps even a good share of the pervasive malaise that leads to crime and war, can ultimately be traced to our unused energy, our untapped potential. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>This general malaise is not due directly to external causes. Unlike so many other nations in the contemporary world, we can’t blame our problems on a harsh environment, on widespread poverty, or on the oppression of a foreign occupying army. The roots of the discontent are internal, and each person must untangle them personally, with his or her own power. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Is this because it is the destiny of mankind to remain unfulfilled, each person always wanting more than he or she can have? Or is the pervasive malaise that often sours even our most precious moments the result of our seeking happiness in the wrong places? <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The three to fourfold increase in social pathology over the last generation holds true in an astonishing number of areas. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The future does not look much rosier. Today’s teenagers show the symptoms of the malaise that ails their elders, sometimes in an even more virulent form. Fewer young people now grow up in families where both parents are present to share the responsibilities involved in bringing up children. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call ontological anxiety, or existential dread. Basically, it is a fear of being, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with. Nothing seems to make sense. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>After a while, however, it becomes obvious that these piecemeal solutions won’t work either. No matter how much energy we devote to its care, the body will eventually give out. If we are learning to be more assertive, we might inadvertently alienate our friends. And if we devote too much time to cultivating new friends, we might threaten relationships with our spouse and family. There are just so many dams about to burst and so little time to tend to them all. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with following this genetic programming and relishing the resulting pleasures it provides, as long as we recognize them for what they are, and as long as we retain some control over them when it is necessary to pursue other goals, to which we might decide to assign priority. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The only authority many people trust today is instinct. If something feels good, if it is natural and spontaneous, then it must be right. But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>A person who cannot override genetic instructions when necessary is always vulnerable. Instead of deciding how to act in terms of personal goals, he has to surrender to the things that his body has been programmed (or misprogrammed) to do. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>He may encounter thousands of potentially fulfilling experiences, but he fails to notice them because they are not the things he desires. What matters is not what he has now, but what he might obtain if he does as others want him to do. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one’s own powers. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>But it is not by abandoning ourselves to instinctual desires that we become free of social controls. We must also become independent from the dictates of the body, and learn to take charge of what happens in the mind. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It is not enough to know how to do it; one must do it, consistently, in the same way as athletes or musicians who must keep practicing what they know in theory. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Control over consciousness cannot be institutionalized. As soon as it becomes part of a set of social rules and norms, it ceases to be effective in the way it was originally intended to be. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To stay on the path of mastery would mean changing himself. How much easier it is to jump into another bed and start the process all over again. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The Hacker has a different attitude. After sort of getting the hang of a thing, he or she is willing to stay on the plateau indefinitely. He doesn't mind skipping stages essential to the development of mas- tery if he can just go out and hack around with fellow hackers. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>At work, he does only enough to get by, leaves on time or early, takes every break, talks instead of doing his job, and wonders why he doesn't get promoted. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>When your tennis partner starts improving his or her game and you don't, the game eventually breaks up. The same thing applies to re- lationships. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Se estiver alerta, com toda a sua atenção voltada para o Agora, você até poderá sentir o Ser, mas jamais conseguirá compreendê-lo mentalmente. <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>A análise lógica pode ser de muito préstimo, se a praticarmos como aprendizado da estilística, como meio de conhecermos a fundo os recursos da linguagem e de nos familiarizarmos com todas as suas variedades. (Barreto, 1954:61) <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Frase é todo enunciado suficiente por si mesmo para estabelecer comunicação. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Mas nem sempre oração (diz-se também proposição) é frase. Em “convém que te apresses” há duas orações mas uma só frase, pois somente o conjunto das duas é que traduz um pensamento completo; isoladas, constituem simples fragmentos de frase (ver 1. Fr., 2.6), pois uma é parte da outra: “que te apresses” é o sujeito de “convém”. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Cada qual é livre para dizer o que quer, mas sob a condição de ser compreendido por aquele a quem se dirija. A linguagem é comunicação, e nada é comunicado se o discurso não é compreendido. Toda mensagem deve ser inteligível. (Cohen, 1966:105-106). <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Entretanto, o paralelismo não constitui uma norma rígida; nem sempre é, pode ou deve ser levado à risca, pois a índole e as tradições da língua impõem ou justificam outros padrões. Trata-se, portanto, de uma diretriz, mas diretriz extremamente eficaz, que muitas vezes saneia a frase, evitando construções incorretas, algumas, inadequadas, outras. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Em conclusão, repetimos: na oração principal deve estar a ideia predominante do período, segundo a intenção do autor, segundo o ponto de vista em que ele, e não o leitor, se coloca. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>(...) sabido que, de modo geral, as posições mais enfáticas num período são quase sempre os seus extremos: no meio ficam as ideias que não parecem merecer o necessário realce. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Como se vê, a organização sintática de um período complexo não é tarefa gratuita. A articulação das orações (ou enunciados) exige faculdades de análise, de discriminação, de raciocínio lógico, enfim. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Por isso, os exemplos de Raul Pompéia são modelares, dignos de imitar: o autor manteve a necessária tensão no período sem que disso resultasse uma frase reptante ou confusa. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Como nas peças dramáticas, o período tenso deve apresentar fases sucessivas: a prótase (início ou introdução), a epítese (conflito) e catástrofe (no drama) ou apódose (desfecho, desenlace). <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Chama-se circunstância (do lat. circum, em redor; stare, estar, o que está em redor ou em torno) a condição particular que acompanha um fato, o acidente que o atenua ou agrava. Em retórica, entende-se por circunstância a própria ação (o quê? lat. quid?), a pessoa (quem? lat. quis?), o lugar (onde? lat. ubi?), o tempo (quando? lat. quando?), a causa (por quê? lat. cur?), o modo (como? lat. quomodo?) e os meios (com quê? lat. quibus auxiliis?). (Ver 3. Par., 3.2.1.)22 No âmbito da análise sintática, a pessoa e a ação, que deixam de ser circunstâncias, correspondem, respectivamente, ao sujeito (ou ao objeto) e ao verbo (ou núcleo do predicado). Mas incluem-se outras circunstâncias, preexistentes a ela, análise, como as de fim ou consequência, oposição, condição, etc. Todas, salvo a pessoa e a ação, assumem uma forma gramatical a que se dá o nome de adjuntos adverbiais ou de orações adverbiais (causais, finais, temporais, concessivas ou de oposição, etc.). <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>No português moderno, não se expressa o agente quando o verbo está na voz passiva dita pronominal, i.e., com o pronome “se”. Mas, no português quinhentista, tal construção era usual: “(mar) que dos feios focas se navega” (Lus., I, 52), “terra toda, que se habita / dessa gente sem lei” (Id., X, 92); vale dizer: “é navegado pelos feios focas”, “é habitada por essa gente sem lei”. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Com o “pois” (explicativo-causal) quase sempre se indica que determinado fato ou ato provoca normalmente outro, numa relação habitual e sabida. No verão, às seis horas da manhã, o Sol já está “de fora”. Isso é um fato normal e conhecido de todos. Se alguém não dispõe de relógio, olha para o céu e diz: “Já deve passar das seis horas, pois o Sol já está de fora”. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Por uma espécie de automatismo psíquico, uma ideia ou imagem quase sempre nos evoca outra que se lhe opõe ou se lhe assemelha. Constitui por assim dizer uma operação normal do espírito estabelecer contrastes e analogias: os primeiros traduzem-se principalmente em antíteses, e as segundas, em comparações e metáforas. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>O apelo à antítese e às suas variantes (oxímoro e paradoxo) parece reflexo da própria realidade, que, por ser múltipla, é em si mesma contrastante. Se fosse homogênea, não poderia o homem captá-la, compreendê-la e senti-la em todas as suas dimensões. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Mas a realidade não é constituída apenas por contrastes; também o é por semelhanças. Perceber semelhanças entre coisas, seres, ideias leva naturalmente a estabelecer comparações ou analogias. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Ora, a realidade concreta oferece uma variedade quase infinita de coisas e seres capazes de traduzir, por particularização e concretização (ou concretude), ideias gerais e abstratas, pois uma das deficiências do espírito humano está na sua incapacidade de abstração absoluta, na incapacidade de isolar conceitos ou conceber ideias desgarradas de todo contato com o mundo objetivo. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Quanto mais concreta e objetiva é a nossa linguagem, tanto mais precisa, tanto mais clara se torna <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>A existência de similitudes no mundo objetivo, a incapacidade de abstração, a pobreza relativa do vocabulário disponível em contraste com a riqueza e a numerosidade das ideias a transmitir e, ainda, o prazer estético da caracterização pitoresca constituem as motivações da metáfora <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>À luz da semântica estruturalista, o processo metafórico diz respeito à organização sêmica da mensagem. A palavra, ou lexema, compõe-se de unidades mínimas de sentido (semas); o conjunto dessas unidades é que dá o significado da palavra (semema). <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>O fundamento e o processo de formação dessa figura (tropo) são os mesmos da metáfora: ambas se baseiam numa relação de similaridade; mas a diferença entre ambas reside ainda no fato de que a catacrese, além de estender o sentido de uma palavra levando-o para fora do seu âmbito estrito e habitual, deixa de ser sentida como metáfora, dado o seu uso corrente. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>A catacrese é, portanto, uma espécie de metáfora morta, em que já não se sente nenhum vestígio de inovação, de criação individual e pitoresca. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Chama-se “corpo” da parábola a narrativa imaginada, ao passo que a lição moral que dela se tira é a sua “alma”. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Quando a metáfora se estereotipa, se vulgariza ou envelhece, acaba como que embotada, perde a sua vivacidade expressiva tal como perde o gume uma faca muito usada. Surge então o clichê metafórico, que caracteriza o estilo vulgar, medíocre, dos principiantes ou dos autores sem imaginação: a estrada serpenteia pela planície, o mar beija a areia, brisa rumorejante, luar prateado, silêncio sepulcral, aurora da vida, flor dos anos, primavera da vida, mais uma página da vida... <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>“We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.” For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>The Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, is a particularly good time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the combination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Current economic thinking, as I’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.” <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>“People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>AT CERTAIN TIMES in history cultures have taken it for granted that a person wasn’t fully human unless he or she learned to master thoughts and feelings. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The function of consciousness is to represent information about what is happening outside and inside the organism in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Without consciousness we would still “know” what is going on, but we would have to react to it in a reflexive, instinctive way. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Over the endless dark centuries of its evolution, the human nervous system has become so complex that it is now able to affect its own states, making it to a certain extent functionally independent of its genetic blueprint and of the objective environment. A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>With this framework in mind, what, then, does it mean to be conscious? It simply means that certain specific conscious events (sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring, and that we are able to direct their course. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The events that constitute consciousness—the “things” we see, feel, think, and desire—are information that we can manipulate and use. Thus we might think of consciousness as intentionally ordered information. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>We may call intentions the force that keeps information in consciousness ordered. Intentions arise in consciousness whenever a person is aware of desiring something or wanting to accomplish something. Intentions are also bits of information, shaped either by biological needs or by internalized social goals. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The hungry person is not aware of the level of sugar in his bloodstream; he knows only that there is a bit of information in his consciousness that he has learned to identify as “hunger.” <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Some people learn to use this priceless resource efficiently, while others waste it. The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Each person allocates his or her limited attention either by focusing it intentionally like a beam of energy—as do E. and R. in the previous examples—or by diffusing it in desultory, random movements. The shape and content of life depend on how attention has been used. Entirely different realities will emerge depending on how it is invested. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Attention is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy. Memories, thoughts, and feelings are all shaped by how we use it. And it is an energy under our control, to do with as we please; hence, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Yet however much we are aware of it, the self is in many ways the most important element of consciousness, for it represents symbolically all of consciousness’s other contents, as well as the pattern of their interrelations. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>If attention, or psychic energy, is directed by the self, and if the self is the sum of the contents of consciousness and the structure of its goals, and if the contents of consciousness and the goals are the result of different ways of investing attention, then we have a system that is going round and round, with no clear causes or effects. At one point we are saying that the self directs attention, at another, that attention determines the self. In fact, both these statements are true: consciousness is not a strictly linear system, but one in which circular causality obtains. Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>One of the main forces that affects consciousness adversely is psychic disorder—that is, information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names, depending on how we experience it: pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy. All these varieties of disorder force attention to be diverted to undesirable objects, leaving us no longer free to use it according to our preferences. Psychic energy becomes unwieldy and ineffective. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or psychic entropy, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness. Prolonged experiences of this kind can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>News of the fall of the stock market will upset the banker, but it might reinforce the sense of self of the political activist. A new piece of information will either create disorder in consciousness, by getting us all worked up to face the threat, or it will reinforce our goals, thereby freeing up psychic energy. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly. There is no need to worry, no reason to question one’s adequacy. But whenever one does stop to think about oneself, the evidence is encouraging: “You are doing all right.” The positive feedback strengthens the self, and more attention is freed to deal with the outer and the inner environment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>While she is immersed in her job every piece of information fits: even when she is temporarily frustrated, she knows what causes the frustration, and she believes that eventually the obstacle can be overcome. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>When a person is able to organize his or her consciousness so as to experience flow as often as possible, the quality of life is inevitably going to improve, because, as in the case of Rico and Pam, even the usually boring routines of work become purposeful and enjoyable. In flow we are in control of our psychic energy, and everything we do adds order to consciousness.</p>
<p>It is really a battle for the self; it is a struggle for establishing control over attention. The struggle does not necessarily have to be physical, as in the case of the climber. But anyone who has experienced flow knows that the deep enjoyment it provides requires an equal degree of disciplined concentration. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow. Complexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>A self that is only differentiated—not integrated—may attain great individual accomplishments, but risks being mired in self-centered egotism. By the same token, a person whose self is based exclusively on integration will be connected and secure, but lack autonomous individuality. Only when a person invests equal amounts of psychic energy in these two processes and avoids both selfishness and conformity is the self likely to reflect complexity. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of our concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Flow is important both because it makes the present instant more enjoyable, and because it builds the self-confidence that allows us to develop skills and make significant contributions to humankind. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Even though there is no easy shortcut to flow, it is possible, if one understands how it works, to transform life—to create more harmony in it and to liberate the psychic energy that otherwise would be wasted in boredom or worry. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Life at its best, these commercials teach, is an endless series of climactic moments. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>In all of this, the specific content isn’t nearly as destructive to mastery as is the rhythm. One epiphany follows another. One fantasy is crowded out by the next. Climax is piled upon climax. There’s no plateau. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>If our life is a good one, a life of mastery, most of it will be spent on the plateau. If not, a large part of it may well be spent in restless, distracted, ultimately self-destructive attempts to escape the plateau. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>“Oh boy. Another plateau. Good. I can just stay on it and keep practicing. Sooner or later, there’ll be another spurt.” It was one of the warmest moments on my journey. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>

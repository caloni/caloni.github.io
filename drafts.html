<p>Estou fazendo um experimento. Tão interessado que estou em entender o self para aprimorá-lo com leituras e releituras de várias fontes distintas que me veio à mente: é este o primeiro tema que devo desenvolver profundamente.</p>
<p>Irei, portanto, rever minhas leituras em paralelo, talvez alguma coisa a mais, e tentarei aumentar a profundidade de um dos meus rascuhos, que ficará por aqui o tempo suficiente até eu ter delineado qual seria um bom roteiro para um texto para este assunto.</p>
<h3>Recortes</h3>
<p>“Não posso mais viver comigo”, pensei. Então, de repente, tomei consciência de como aquele pensamento era peculiar. “Eu sou um ou sou dois? Se eu não consigo mais viver comigo, deve haver dois de mim: o ‘eu’ e o ‘eu interior’, com quem o ‘eu’ não consegue mais conviver.” “Talvez”, pensei, “só um dos dois seja real.” <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>Embora eu continuasse vivendo normalmente, tinha percebido que nada que eu viesse a fazer poderia mudar realmente a minha vida. Eu já tinha tudo de que necessitava. <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>Tempos depois, as pessoas iriam se aproximar de mim e dizer: “Quero o que você tem. Você pode me dar ou me mostrar como conseguir?” Eu respondia: “Você já tem. Mas não consegue sentir porque a sua mente está fazendo muito barulho.” <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>All that we are is the result of all that we have thought. It is founded on thought. It is based on thought. — Buddha, The Dhammapada <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The Thinker can think about virtually anything. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on one law only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>Of course, it is fairly easy to see that other people’s minds operate this way; it is comparatively much harder to become aware that one’s own mind is working that way also. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>The reader will absolutely not understand this book unless he or she does the exercizes given at the end of each chapter. <a href="posts.html?q=2">2</a></p>
<p>Mas a verdade é que uma das características de nossa época, uma das fontes ou causas das angústias, conflitos e aflições do nosso tempo parece que está na complexidade, na diversidade e na infidedignidade da comunicação oral ou escrita, quer entre indivíduos quer entre grupos. Sabemos dos mal-entendidos, dos preconceitos, das prevenções, das incompreensões e dos atritos resultantes da incúria da expressão, dos seus sofismas e paralogismos. São as generalizações apressadas, as declarações gratuitas, as indiscriminações, os clichês, os rótulos, os falsos axiomas, a polissemia, a polarização, os falsos juízos, as opiniões discriminatórias, as afirmações puras e simples, carentes de prova... Enfim, linguagem falaciosa, por malícia, quando não por incúria da atividade mental, ou por ignorância dos mais comezinhos princípios da lógica. Esses óbices ou barreiras verbais e mentais impedem ou desfiguram totalmente a comunicação, o entendimento entre os homens e os povos, sendo não raro causa de atritos e conflitos. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>You started with something difficult and made it easy and pleasurable through instruction and practice. You took a master's journey. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>For most people brought up in this society, the plateau can be a form of purgatory. It triggers dis- owned emotions. It flushes out hidden motivations. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The evidence is clear: all of us who are born with- out serious genetic defects are born geniuses. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>But genius, no matter how bright, will come to naught or swiftly burn out if you don't choose the master's journey. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Learning any new skill involves relatively brief spurts of progress, each of which is followed by a slight decline to a plateau somewhat higher in most cases than that which pre- ceded it. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The cognitive and effort systems become subsets of the habitual system long enough to modify it, to teach it a new behavior. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>This brings into play what might be called a cog- nitive system, associated with the habitual system, and an effort system, associated with the hippocam- pus (situated at the base of the brain). <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>In this light, you can see that those upward surges on the mastery curve are by no means the only time anything significant or exciting is happening. Learn- ing generally occurs in stages. A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have with- drawn. This means you can perform the task without making a special effort to think of its separate parts. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>How do you best move toward mastery? To put it simply, you practice diligently, but you practice pri- marily for the sake of the practice itself. Rather than being frustrated while on the plateau, you learn to appreciate and enjoy it just as much as you do the upward surges. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>In the forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed forty-four films that received twenty-three Academy Award nominations—an absurd rate of artistic productivity. Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing all his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3 manual typewriter. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected isolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These subsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John Freeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The Distraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Given this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this book trying to establish this point. We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today. There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning. We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances. <a href="posts.html?q=5">5</a></p>
<p>People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>So how can we reach this elusive goal that cannot be attained by a direct route? My studies of the past quarter-century have convinced me that there is a way. It is a circuitous path that begins with achieving control over the contents of our consciousness. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.” <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature. At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. The Romans reached that juncture after several centuries of ruling the Mediterranean, the Chinese were confident of their immutable superiority before the Mongol conquest, and the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening. When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It might well be, in fact, that much of the world's depression and discontent, and perhaps even a good share of the pervasive malaise that leads to crime and war, can ultimately be traced to our unused energy, our untapped potential. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>This general malaise is not due directly to external causes. Unlike so many other nations in the contemporary world, we can’t blame our problems on a harsh environment, on widespread poverty, or on the oppression of a foreign occupying army. The roots of the discontent are internal, and each person must untangle them personally, with his or her own power. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Is this because it is the destiny of mankind to remain unfulfilled, each person always wanting more than he or she can have? Or is the pervasive malaise that often sours even our most precious moments the result of our seeking happiness in the wrong places? <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The three to fourfold increase in social pathology over the last generation holds true in an astonishing number of areas. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The future does not look much rosier. Today’s teenagers show the symptoms of the malaise that ails their elders, sometimes in an even more virulent form. Fewer young people now grow up in families where both parents are present to share the responsibilities involved in bringing up children. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call ontological anxiety, or existential dread. Basically, it is a fear of being, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with. Nothing seems to make sense. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>After a while, however, it becomes obvious that these piecemeal solutions won’t work either. No matter how much energy we devote to its care, the body will eventually give out. If we are learning to be more assertive, we might inadvertently alienate our friends. And if we devote too much time to cultivating new friends, we might threaten relationships with our spouse and family. There are just so many dams about to burst and so little time to tend to them all. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>It is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with following this genetic programming and relishing the resulting pleasures it provides, as long as we recognize them for what they are, and as long as we retain some control over them when it is necessary to pursue other goals, to which we might decide to assign priority. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The only authority many people trust today is instinct. If something feels good, if it is natural and spontaneous, then it must be right. But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>A person who cannot override genetic instructions when necessary is always vulnerable. Instead of deciding how to act in terms of personal goals, he has to surrender to the things that his body has been programmed (or misprogrammed) to do. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>He may encounter thousands of potentially fulfilling experiences, but he fails to notice them because they are not the things he desires. What matters is not what he has now, but what he might obtain if he does as others want him to do. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one’s own powers. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>But it is not by abandoning ourselves to instinctual desires that we become free of social controls. We must also become independent from the dictates of the body, and learn to take charge of what happens in the mind. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It is not enough to know how to do it; one must do it, consistently, in the same way as athletes or musicians who must keep practicing what they know in theory. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>Control over consciousness cannot be institutionalized. As soon as it becomes part of a set of social rules and norms, it ceases to be effective in the way it was originally intended to be. <a href="posts.html?q=6">6</a></p>
<p>To stay on the path of mastery would mean changing himself. How much easier it is to jump into another bed and start the process all over again. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>The Hacker has a different attitude. After sort of getting the hang of a thing, he or she is willing to stay on the plateau indefinitely. He doesn't mind skipping stages essential to the development of mas- tery if he can just go out and hack around with fellow hackers. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>At work, he does only enough to get by, leaves on time or early, takes every break, talks instead of doing his job, and wonders why he doesn't get promoted. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>When your tennis partner starts improving his or her game and you don't, the game eventually breaks up. The same thing applies to re- lationships. <a href="posts.html?q=4">4</a></p>
<p>Se estiver alerta, com toda a sua atenção voltada para o Agora, você até poderá sentir o Ser, mas jamais conseguirá compreendê-lo mentalmente. <a href="posts.html?q=1">1</a></p>
<p>A análise lógica pode ser de muito préstimo, se a praticarmos como aprendizado da estilística, como meio de conhecermos a fundo os recursos da linguagem e de nos familiarizarmos com todas as suas variedades. (Barreto, 1954:61) <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Frase é todo enunciado suficiente por si mesmo para estabelecer comunicação. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Mas nem sempre oração (diz-se também proposição) é frase. Em “convém que te apresses” há duas orações mas uma só frase, pois somente o conjunto das duas é que traduz um pensamento completo; isoladas, constituem simples fragmentos de frase (ver 1. Fr., 2.6), pois uma é parte da outra: “que te apresses” é o sujeito de “convém”. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Cada qual é livre para dizer o que quer, mas sob a condição de ser compreendido por aquele a quem se dirija. A linguagem é comunicação, e nada é comunicado se o discurso não é compreendido. Toda mensagem deve ser inteligível. (Cohen, 1966:105-106). <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Entretanto, o paralelismo não constitui uma norma rígida; nem sempre é, pode ou deve ser levado à risca, pois a índole e as tradições da língua impõem ou justificam outros padrões. Trata-se, portanto, de uma diretriz, mas diretriz extremamente eficaz, que muitas vezes saneia a frase, evitando construções incorretas, algumas, inadequadas, outras. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Em conclusão, repetimos: na oração principal deve estar a ideia predominante do período, segundo a intenção do autor, segundo o ponto de vista em que ele, e não o leitor, se coloca. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>(...) sabido que, de modo geral, as posições mais enfáticas num período são quase sempre os seus extremos: no meio ficam as ideias que não parecem merecer o necessário realce. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Como se vê, a organização sintática de um período complexo não é tarefa gratuita. A articulação das orações (ou enunciados) exige faculdades de análise, de discriminação, de raciocínio lógico, enfim. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
<p>Por isso, os exemplos de Raul Pompéia são modelares, dignos de imitar: o autor manteve a necessária tensão no período sem que disso resultasse uma frase reptante ou confusa. <a href="posts.html?q=3">3</a></p>
